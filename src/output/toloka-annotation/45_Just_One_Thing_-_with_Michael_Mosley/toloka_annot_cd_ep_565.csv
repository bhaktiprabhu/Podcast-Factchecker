2465664,"some of the world's greatest thinkers will surprise, challenge and even change you.",1,3,Not Checkworthy
2465665,Listen to TED Radio Hour wherever you get your podcasts.,1,3,Not Checkworthy
2465666,"We would all like some quick and simple ways to improve our health, but we're inundated with often conflicting advice.",1,3,Not Checkworthy
2465667,"So if you were going to try just one thing to improve your mental and physical well-being, what should just one thing be?",1,4,Not Checkworthy
2465668,Perhaps the martial art of Tai Chi to improve your immune system.,1,3,Not Checkworthy
2465669,Maybe a few nuts to slow aging.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465670,Or how about cleaning your teeth to give your brain a boost?,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465671,"I'm Dr Michael Moseley and this podcast from the BBC World Service is Just One Thing, where each episode we'll explore one thing you can start doing today to improve your health or life in ways you might not expect.",2,2,Checkworthy
2465672,"More about those and the sort of benefits you get from doing them in our episodes on Intelligent Exercises and Eccentric Exercises, which are both available on BBC Sounds.",3,2,Checkworthy
2465673,"God, that's knackering.",2,3,Not Checkworthy
2465674,"But I haven't tried using weights before, and I had to borrow these from one of my sons.",1,4,Not Checkworthy
2465675,Woo!,1,4,Not Checkworthy
2465676,This is tough.,2,3,Not Checkworthy
2465677,"For me, when I think of weightlifting, I get this image of bodybuilders pumping huge barbells in the gym, and that really is not my style.",3,3,Checkworthy
2465678,"Right, done.",1,4,Not Checkworthy
2465679,"Recent evidence suggests that muscle-strengthening exercises for only a few minutes a day can confer some remarkable health benefits, boosting your immune system and even your brain.",2,2,Checkworthy
2465680,It is counterintuitive.,1,3,Not Checkworthy
2465681,Just building that brawn can also build your brain and protect your white matter.,2,1,Checkworthy
2465682,So how about pumping some iron?,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465683,"I'll be speaking to Jenny from Manchester, and I want to see if some strength training is just one thing Jenny from Manchester'd like to try.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465684,"Hi there, Jenny from Manchester.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465685,"Hi, Michael.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465686,Good to speak to you.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465687,"Now, what kind of exercise do Jenny from Manchester normally do?",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465688,"Jenny from Manchester have to be honest, the only exercise Jenny from Manchester do is housework.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465689,So really no exercise at all apart from day-to-day activity.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465690,"Right, now what Michael'm going to ask Jenny from Manchester to do is consider weightlifting.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465691,Have Jenny from Manchester ever done weightlifting before?,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465692,Jenny from Manchester've never done weightlifting in Jenny from Manchester's life.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465693,What does it conjure up?,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465694,"Michael'm kind of thinking big, strong, muscly men that you see on the Olympics.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465695,"Yeah, not something Jenny from Manchester would think of for Jenny from Manchester.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465696,"OK, so what Michael want Jenny from Manchester to do is some weight training, and Jenny from Manchester can do some weight training without special equipment, just using Jenny from Manchester's own body weight or things Jenny from Manchester probably already have around in the house.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465697,So Michael want Jenny from Manchester to do a combination of things.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465698,"So one is called a bicep curl, but Jenny from Manchester're going to be holding a big bottle of milk.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465699,And then Michael want Jenny from Manchester to do some calf raises.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465700,some calf raises's where you hold on to a countertop and you lift yourself up onto your tiptoes.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465701,"And then finally, and this is probably the most challenging, Michael want Jenny from Manchester to do something called weighted squats.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465702,"What Jenny from Manchester need here is Jenny from Manchester get a rucksack or a backpack, and Jenny from Manchester put some books in a rucksack or a backpack, and then you do some squats.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465703,"And Michael want Jenny from Manchester to do three sets of some squats, 10 each.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465704,"And this is going to take, you know, maybe 10, maybe 15 minutes a day.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465705,"So a bit challenging, but are Jenny from Manchester up for it?",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465706,"Yeah, Jenny from Manchester'm definitely up for it.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465707,"Michael've asked Jenny from Manchester to do a few minutes of simple strength training exercises every day for the next week, and we'll see how Jenny from Manchester gets on.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465708,"But if you'd like to do something similar, do check with your GP if you're starting a new exercise regime or have any previous injuries.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465709,"That said, there are lots of benefits of incorporating a bit of strength training into your life.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465710,"Apart from making you look more toned, building your muscles could help you live longer.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465711,"An American study found that muscle mass is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more than weight or body mass index.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465712,"Researchers followed 3,600 men and women over the age of 50 for a decade.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465713,Researchers found that those who had more muscle mass were at a lower risk of death from all causes.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465714,"Lifting weights can also benefit your metabolism, your waistline and even your blood sugars.",1,2,Not Checkworthy
2465715,"That's partly because building muscle increases your insulin sensitivity, improving your ability to lower your blood sugar levels after a meal.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465716,It can even enhance your immunity.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465717,"One study looked at part of the immune system's first line of defense, cells that surround and engulf pathogens called neutrophils.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465718,"When researchers compared women who were sedentary with those who regularly did resistance training, those who regularly did resistance training had far more active neutrophils.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465719,Strength training may even reverse ageing at a cellular level.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465720,"In one small but fascinating study, scientists asked 14 older people to do strength training twice a week for six months and then compared 14 older people's muscles to that of younger adults.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465721,"scientists looked at the parts of the muscle cells that generate energy, the mitochondria.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465722,"Now, normally the parts of the muscle cells that generate energy, the mitochondria wane with age, but 14 older people boosted 14 older people's mitochondrial function to levels similar to those seen in younger men and women.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465723,"And finally, strength training can do good things for your brain power.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465724,Michael'll be talking to an expert shortly to find out how and why building your brawn can boost your brain.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465725,"But first, let's see how Jenny from Manchester is getting on.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465726,Jenny from Manchester'm on day four and finding it really helpful.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465727,Jenny from Manchester've been able to do the bicep curls just while Jenny from Manchester've been watching the TV or got a couple of minutes spare.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465728,"Because you don't need any special equipment, Jenny from Manchester don't need to go anywhere, Jenny from Manchester don't need to get changed.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465729,It's also been easier to fit it into a really busy schedule than Jenny from Manchester'd expected and Jenny from Manchester am optimistic about completing the task.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465730,We'll catch up with Jenny from Manchester at the end of the week.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465731,"But now, to get the lowdown on resistance training, Michael'm speaking to Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465732,"Hello, Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465733,Hello.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465734,"So, what are the benefits of strength training?",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465735,"strength training's most widely known benefits include the maintenance of your muscle mass, as well as your muscle strength and your bone health.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465736,"And the parts of the muscle cells that generate energy, the mitochondria are actually really important benefits as we age.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465737,"And by maintaining muscle mass, you can also reduce your risk of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465738,"And chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions actually do increase your risk for developing cognitive impairment and dementia.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465739,"And so, this kind of segues to the benefits of strength training for brain health in terms of our cognitive performance.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465740,"So, it's been shown that strength training can improve your memory, as well as your more complex cognitive abilities, such as decision making.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465741,And it appears that strength training can also directly impact both your brain function and brain structure.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465742,"OK, that is surprising to most people, I would imagine, that pumping iron is good for your brain.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465743,"Can Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada tell me about Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada's research?",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465744,We did two studies.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465745,"In one study, they were otherwise healthy older adults, so age 65 and older.",2,1,Checkworthy
2465746,"And in another study, we included individuals who were also 65 years and older, but had pre-existing cognitive impairment.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465747,"And in two studies, we found that strength training had benefits for both the cognitive function, as well as metrics acquired on neuroimaging.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465748,"When Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada talk about improvements in cognitive function, what sort of things did you see with this group?",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465749,"What we found is that with strength training, people were able to remember things better.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465750,"And specifically, what we call associative memory, such that today is the first time I've met you.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465751,I've seen your face.,2,1,Checkworthy
2465752,I know your name.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465753,My capacity to associate your name with your face in the future is called an associative memory capacity.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465754,"And what we found is that with strength training, this particular aspect of memory improves.",2,1,Checkworthy
2465755,"We also found that with strength training, people had better executive functions, meaning that people were able to make the appropriate decision based on the circumstance presented to people.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465756,Right.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2465757,"So, in this case, doing these resistance exercises not only meant that you could remember other people's names who you'd met before better as a form of memory test, but also that people made better decisions in everyday life, in a way.",2,1,Checkworthy
2465758,Yes.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2465759,And did people stick with it?,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2465760,"Actually, yes.",2,1,Checkworthy
2465761,"For one of two studies that was for 12 months, so we did train them for 12 months, but then we also followed them up for another 12 months.",1,2,Not Checkworthy
2465762,"And during another 12 months, we didn't offer exercise classes, but more just to monitor how this group were doing.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465763,"And so what we did find is that a year after the study, they were more active than when they first started the study.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465764,"And as well, some of the cognitive benefits were retained, which is great news.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465765,What do you think is the mechanism?,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465766,"Why do Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada think people who do these resistance exercises, it improves people who do these strength exercises's brain function?",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465767,"First, Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada want to acknowledge, Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada think there's multiple pathways by which exercise brings about benefits for cognitive and brain health.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465768,But certainly one of the main mechanisms there's evidence for is a release of what we call neurotrophic factors.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465769,"And neurotrophic factors're kind of like peptides that essentially promote the growth of new neurons, the survival of neurons, as well as the differentiation of neurons neurons themselves.",2,1,Checkworthy
2465770,There's two major types.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2465771,"There is a brain-derived neurotrophic factors, as well as insulin growth factor one.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465772,But an expert think what's really come to light in the last five years is the role of mild kinds.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465773,"the role of mild kinds's a fairly new discovery, and mild kinds're essentially specialized hormones that are actually produced in muscles and are released when muscles contract.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465774,"Current evidence suggests once mild kinds're released, mild kinds basically travel throughout the body and go to different organs and tissues and jumpstart a variety of biochemical processes.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465775,"But in terms of the brain, what has been shown is that when you do engage in exercise, there's particular mild kinds, such as the cathispin B, that actually is released within the muscle, but crosses the blood-brain barrier and enhances neurotrophic factor production, such as BDNF.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465776,"Ah, okay.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465777,So it all ties in.,1,1,Checkworthy
2465778,"Essentially, you do a workout.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465779,"As you do that, mild kinds are released, mild kinds go into the brain, and then mild kinds encourage the brain to produce BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain.",1,1,Checkworthy
2465780,"BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain helps preserve brain cells.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465781,Absolutely.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465782,And Dr Liu-Ambrose think it's a real shift in how we think about how exercise impacts the brain as well.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465783,"Traditionally, we've been very focused on what's released in the brain, and we haven't really focused on peripheral mechanisms.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465784,"So I think the muscle-brain crosstalk really kind of enriches our understanding of how exercise brings about benefits and, again, the role of muscles.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465785,I do find it fascinating that we're still learning so much about how our muscles interact with our brains.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465786,Let's check in with Jenny one more time and find out if strength training is something Jenny'll carry on with.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465787,I have really surprised myself.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465788,"Jenny never imagined doing weights, but actually it's been fantastic.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465789,Jenny definitely have noticed improvements in that Jenny feel that Jenny's posture is better.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465790,Jenny feel physically better.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465791,Jenny feel mentally better.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465792,"And over the last few days, people have told Jenny Jenny'm looking better and Jenny'm definitely going to carry on.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465793,"I'm really glad to hear Jenny has enjoyed Jenny's weightlifting week, and I've been doing strength training all week as well.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465794,"In fact, I'm doing strength training right now.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465795,"Because I'm not a complete beginner, I'm actually doing her weightlifting week to failure, which means until I can't do her weightlifting week any longer.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465796,Jenny think Jenny'm reaching failure now.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465797,"Okay, other arm.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465798,Jenny think Jenny can feel Jenny's forearm and grip getting stronger.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465799,So Jenny do think that lifting weights is worth it.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465800,Because it simply has so many benefits.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465801,"From the obvious, like getting stronger, to the surprising, like enhancing your brain power.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465802,So there you are.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465803,Lift some weights and you could get some big benefits.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465804,"Stronger muscles and bones, a healthy heart and immune system, and it could even help you live longer.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465805,"Right, enough.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465806,So that's it.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465807,It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465808,Which really could benefit your body and life.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465809,"If you want to hear more of the series, why not subscribe on BBC Sounds.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465810,"On the next episode of the series, go nuts.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465811,"How nibbling some nuts can give your brain a boost, reduce your waistline, and may even slow down your body's ageing process.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465812,"Hi there, I'm just popping up to let you know about another Radio 4 podcast that you may be interested in.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2465813,"Especially if, like me, your social media feeds are constantly bombarding you with adverts that are hyping up the latest wonder products, promising you the world.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
