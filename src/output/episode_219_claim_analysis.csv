2290520,"Hey, hey, and welcome folks, this is The Ben Shapiro Show.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290521,"Yeah, it's a Sunday, but you know what we've decided to start doing on Sundays?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290522,We're going to drop you a little bit of mailbag wisdom.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2290524,"Now, you have to be a subscriber in order to have those questions answered, which is why you should go subscribe right now at dailywireplus.com.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2290526,"Corey says, Ben, I live in Washington State, where the legislature has recently passed bills allowing gender-affirming care of minors without parental consent.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290527,"I'm bothered that the Washington House and Senate Republicans don't point out the horrible truth of what's actually happening, such as the sterilization and removal of healthy body parts of minors, as Matt Walsh does.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290528,"Instead, they use the left's euphemism of gender-affirming care.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290529,It seems to me they're losing the debate before it begins by allowing the truth to be obfuscated.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290530,Is there any strategic reason for Republicans to speak the gender-affirming language?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290531,Not one iota of a reason.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290532,The left is so fond of euphemisms.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290533,It's euphemism after euphemism.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290534,"And gender-affirming care replaces the just-as-euphemistic sex-change surgery, because you can't actually change your sex.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290535,It's euphemism upon euphemism.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290536,It started off with sex-change surgery.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290537,Then it was hormone replacement therapy.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290538,Now it's gender-affirming care.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290539,"Again, all of this is euphemism.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290540,"What it should be is sex-denying treatment, because that's what it is.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290541,You are denying your own actual biological sex by altering your body and your hormones.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290542,That is what you are doing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290543,The right should never give on this point.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290544,"I mean, it's ridiculous.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290545,"We do the same thing with abortion, by the way, the right.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290546,"Even the term abortion or termination of a pregnancy, it is the killing of the unborn.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290547,That is what you are doing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290548,I can make the argument as to what the status of the unborn is at any given point.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290549,But the idea that you are not killing the thing that is unborn is obviously untrue.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290550,That is the thing that is happening.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290551,"Jeremy says, What do you think the U.S. could do to win back the trust of its allies?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290552,"Also, assuming France truly decides to become politically non-aligned and move away from the United States, what do you think are the chances of France becoming an independent superpower?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290553,"A very, very low.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290554,France does not have the ability to become an independent superpower.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290555,"Now, France has the most durability of any other country on the continent.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290556,"It's like Germany and France are the two most durable countries on the continent of Europe, mainly because the reproduction rate in France is actually fairly decent.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290557,Like they're still reproducing at a kind of normal rate.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290558,"They're like 1.9 births per woman, which is fairly high by sort of Western standards, even though it's below replacement rates.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290559,"Right now, Germany is like 1.6.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290560,The United States is kind of around the German number.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290561,"We're like 1.8, 1.782.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290562,Somewhere in there.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290563,So France is the healthiest in terms of demographics.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290564,"They're also importing a huge young population from northern Africa, right, the big Moroccan population coming in, Libyan population coming into France as well.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290565,Their economy doesn't allow them to really grow at extraordinarily rapid rates.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290566,"They do obviously have nuclear weapons, the French, and they have a not insignificant military.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290567,But the idea they're ever an independent sort of power is wrong.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290568,"The idea of an aligned Europe that acts as a counterweight to both the United States and China has long been a European dream, but they seem unwilling to actually pay the freight for that.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290569,"Craig says, Ben, I want to ask about two groups of voters when comparing the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290570,"In 2016, Trump won almost 63 million votes.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290571,"In 2020, he won 74.25 million votes.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290572,Where did the 11.25 million votes come from for Trump who got mobilized?,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290573,"On the flip side, Hillary won about 65 million votes in 2016.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290574,Biden won about 81.25 million new votes in 2020.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290575,Do you think media manipulation and hatred of Hillary explains the 16 million new votes that went to Biden?,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290576,That seems like far too high a number to blame on low information voter.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290577,"Well, the answer is that the 2020 election cycle had just a massive voter turnout.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290578,"I mean, the voter turnout rate had the highest voter turnout of the 21st century.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290579,At 67% of citizens aged 18 and older voted in the election in 2020.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290580,"In 2016, the voter turnout rate was like 59%.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290581,So that is a much lower number.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290582,"You had 59% of a voting age population of 249 million in 2016, so 60%.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290583,You had almost a two-thirds voter turnout rate with an increased population of 258 million who are eligible to vote.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290584,That's the answer.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290585,"The answer is every election, there's a growing population in the United States.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290586,"And 2020, because of all the mail-in ballots and all the you-can-vote-five-months-in-advance garbage, because of that, it was the highest voter turnout rate in modern American history.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290587,"Again, we have not seen a voter turnout rate that high pretty much ever.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290588,Pretty much ever.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290589,"Turnout as a percentage of eligible voters, I mean, back in 1980, it was like 54%.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290590,And then it stayed in the 50s all the way up to 2004.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290591,We got 60%.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290592,"Then in 2008, it was 62.5%.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290593,Back down to the 50s for 2012 and 2016.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290594,And then 67% in 2020.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290595,So that would be your answer.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290596,That's where all those extra voters came from.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290597,"Mark says, hey, Ben.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290598,Thanks for everything you and DW Plus do.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290599,"When I was recently talking, one of my liberal friends about the Dilma-Veini Bud Light story, he told me conservatives are hypocrites because we told them not to be offended by a lady on a syrup bottle.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290600,And now we are offended by a lady on a beer can.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290601,How would you respond to this?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290602,Are conservatives hypocrites on this?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290603,"No, because there is nothing inherently offensive about a black woman on a syrup bottle.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290604,I don't find black women offensive.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290605,There's something inherently offensive about a man pretending to be a woman.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290606,That's the thing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290607,"Now, I assume that we're talking now about the Aunt Jemima bottle.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290608,And the idea was that this was linked to slavery.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290609,And this was linked to sort of reconstruction era imagery of black people.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290610,"The point that I was making is that I'm not sure anybody has ever actually had syrup from the Aunt Jemima bottle was thinking, man, slavery.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290611,That was a great thing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290612,Reconstruction.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290613,That was a great thing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290614,"And if I thought that, or anti-reconstruction rather, that was a great thing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290615,"If I thought that, I would also be against that bottle.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290616,But that's not what it was about.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290617,"The whole point is with Bud Light, you're actually saying, yes, this is a great thing, what this man is doing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290618,"Benjamin says, hey, Ben, love the show.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290619,Proud to be an All Access member.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290620,My question is regarding the 2024 election.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290621,Biden technically has yet to announce he'll actually run.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290622,I realize he will most likely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290623,"However, let's assume he doesn't.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290624,Who do you believe would become the Democratic nominee?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290625,So Democrats have boxed themselves into the intersectional square.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290626,There's nothing they can really do here.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290627,Kamala Harris is going to be the presumptive nominee.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290628,That is particularly true because they now shifted the voting states in the Democratic primaries.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290629,"I believe South Carolina now goes first, which cuts out like Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, all white people all the time vote.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290630,So the chances that Kamala Harris ends up as the nominee are fairly high.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290631,She has the highest name recognition.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290632,This is what the polls are showing as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290633,She leads the sort of replaced Biden sweepstakes.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290634,"Now, you could theoretically see somebody like Gavin Newsom throw his hat in the ring.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290635,And presumably he'd have an advantage in California.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290636,Although I'm not so sure.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290637,I'm not so sure.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290638,"Austin says, hey, Mr. Shapiro, I have a quick question regarding modesty.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290639,I'm a young Christian man currently going to a secular college.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290640,"I grew up in a family and church that put a high emphasis on modesty, both male and female.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290641,I've struggled to see where the Old and New Testament talks about this in any detail.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290642,I'm trying to determine what I believe so I can live according to this idea and leave my future family in accordance with both scriptures and morality.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290643,"I was wondering if you could give me a definition of modesty, answer if it is important, and ways this can be lived in day-to-day life.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290644,Thank you for all that you do and all those you influence.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290645,"I know you have helped me in several ways, including the idea that facts matter more than my feelings and to approach things from truth no matter what the stance.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290646,"Okay, so the idea of modesty, the definition of modesty is dressing in a way that is not designed to elicit a sexual response.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290647,That is the definition of modesty.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290648,That doesn't mean you have to dress like a Frump.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290649,It doesn't mean you have to dress in an old sack.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290650,You don't have to wear a burka.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290651,"What it does mean is that if you are dressing in a way that is deliberately sexually provocative, then that is immodest.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290652,And to pretend that all items of clothing are similar in terms of their sexual provocativeness is just silly.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290653,"Now, even to use the term sexually provocative now is controversial because we are all supposed to be men and women of stone.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290654,We're supposed to pretend that you're supposed to have exactly the same response to a woman wearing a thong bikini on the beach as you would to a woman wearing a three-piece business suit or something.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290655,"That's silly and stupid, and everyone knows that it's silly and stupid, which is why advertising does not feature generally women in business suits walking on the beach, but does very frequently feature bucks and women on the beach wearing thong bikinis.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290656,There's a reason for that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290657,"And when women dress like this, to pretend that they do not know that this is designed to elicit a response is, of course, incredibly silly.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290658,The entire lingerie business is designed around this exact notion.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290659,The same thing in miniature is true of men.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290660,Women are not as visually driven by sort of sexual stimuli as men are.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290661,"As I've said before, when it comes to women and sex, men and sex, very different mentalities.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290662,"For women, they need to know why.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290663,"For men, they need to know when and where.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290664,Those are the big questions.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290665,"And so the idea that women, there's a wide variety of clothing women can wear that is more sexually provocative than what a man can wear is 100% true.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290666,"Of course, of course.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290667,"Now, there are areas of debate here.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290668,"I've had these debates with, for example, my friend who's a very conservative Christian, Allie Beth Stuckey.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290669,Allie and I have had the yoga pants debate.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290670,"I've suggested that yoga pants are significantly sexually provocative to men, the reason being that women spray paint their ass very often and then assume that men are not looking at that, which, of course, is very, very stupid.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290671,"And Allie's like, well, yeah,",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290672,but they're comfortable at the gym.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290673,And so I'm not wearing it to provoke men.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290674,"Yes, but that does not change whether an item of clothing is objectively more sexually provocative than another item of clothing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290675,"And this is all this is what this is the conversation reasonable people would have, we're not allowed to have these conversations again, we're supposed to now pretend that if a woman wears a thong bikini, walks into the office, it's a job of men to like avert their eyes.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290676,A woman has done nothing whatsoever that elicits a response.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290677,"Now, again, all of human life is meant to elicit emotional responses from other people.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290678,We're constantly doing that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290679,We're constantly acting and saying things in ways that elicit responses from other people.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290680,We are not made of stone.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290681,"But here we're supposed to, again, pretend that the human the most deep and abiding human instinct, the instinct to sexuality doesn't exist in this context so that we can pretend that somehow decisions don't elicit responses or something or the men and women are the same.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290682,"Charlotte says, I live in the suburbs of Chicago.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290683,Anything that happens here strongly impacts what happens in my life.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290684,How do you think Brandon Johnson will impact Chicago now that he's mayor?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290685,"He's like Lori Lightfoot, but a dude.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290686,It's he's a disaster area.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290687,And we've already seen this week like rioting in the loop.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290688,People just beating the crap out of each other.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290689,People getting shot in the loop.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290690,There's like downtown Chicago.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290691,Nice area of Chicago.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290692,"And Brandon Johnson's like, it's like John Valjean.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290693,It's like people who are desperate.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290694,They're just looting because they're desperate.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290695,"No, they're not.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290696,They're looting because it's fun to loot and there aren't cops enough to stop them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290697,"But Brandon Johnson's like, well, but if we had midnight basketball, that might save it.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290698,"Yeah, good luck, guys.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290699,You made this decision.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290700,Enjoy it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290701,"Dan says, I'm thinking about going to law school.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290702,I've heard the job market is oversaturated.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290703,You mentioned before you think maybe A.I. will eventually replace a lot of the lawyering workspace.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290704,Mentioned a long time ago you wanted to find third year law school paper about judicial review and Marbury versus Madison.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290705,Did you ever find it?,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290706,"No, I tried desperately.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290707,I actually emailed my law school advisor on that paper.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290708,I would like to find it somewhere.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290709,I may have like a laptop going back.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290710,Now it'd be 15 years.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290711,I have to dig through my garage and then send it to my friends over at Legacybox and see if they can preserve it for me.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290712,"Caroline says, I was in a conversation with two colleagues discussing school choices and how it seems ridiculous that if you choose to send your kids to a private school, you still have to pay state taxes for public school.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290713,They were saying it's a good thing because wealthy people can afford private schools.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290714,"If they don't pay taxes toward those already in poor schools, those schools will never improve.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290715,Children from low income areas and families only have public schools in their district as an option and are the only ones paying taxes toward those schools.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290716,There's a cycle of poverty and a lack of education.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290717,What do you think is an appropriate solution to solve this issue?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290718,Thanks for what you do.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290719,"So the idea that that state taxes should go to public schools and that if you're in a private school, you should still continue to pay tax and those taxes should go to public.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290720,I don't actually have a huge problem with that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290721,"Again, we all have a stake in there being kids going to schools.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290722,"I would prefer this be done on the most local available level and that instead of paying state taxes, this very often, by the way, is the way that it works.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290723,It's not all state education dollars.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290724,Very often it's local education dollars.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290725,"The more local, the better.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290726,I have a very high stake in kids in my neighborhood going to school and I'm willing to help subsidize that as a function of my local community.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290727,"I'm not willing to do that at the national level because frankly, I don't think the federal government is good at running this thing or distributing the money.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290728,"But yeah, there are obviously things in your local community where you have a stake in it like kids going to your school.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290729,"And really, it's not about people like me where I'm sending my own kids to school.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290730,So I'm already paying for schooling.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290731,"It's about people who don't have kids in school and retirees, right?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290732,That should really be the question.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290733,"Are those, should those people be subsidizing education?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290734,The general idea here is the community does have an interest in subsidizing education.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290735,And I think virtually everybody does believe that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290736,Whether that should go to public school or whether it should go to vouchers is a different question.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290737,I think it should go to vouchers.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290738,"Zach says, what authors can I trust to read about American world presidential history?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290739,"Some authors like John Meacham, can I look at their Twitter feed to see if I can trust them?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290740,But what is your process for weaning out political lean in history books when it comes to older and deceased authors?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290741,God bless.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290742,"So my favorite thing to read on the weekends, I love the Wall Street Journal book review section.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290743,I love it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290744,It comes every Shabbat and coffee and the Wall Street Journal book review section is like my favorite thing.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290745,This is like my life's little pleasures.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290746,And so I tend to read the reviews of the books and see how it's reviewed in places like the Wall Street Journal or the New Criterion.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290747,"I found reviewers that I trust and then if they recommend the book, then I usually will give it a shot.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290748,And this is where the blurbs actually matter.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290749,"Now, beware with blurbs.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290750,"As a person who has blurbed many a book, when famous people give blurbs to books, that doesn't necessarily mean they've read the book, which is why you should read a couple of book reviews of the book.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290751,"Matt says, I don't understand all the rules for the Jewish Sabbath.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290752,"Well, yeah, there are a lot of them.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290753,I understand the idea of taking a day to rest.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290754,Why don't you flip a light switch or drive a car?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290755,How's turning on the lights a violation of the Sabbath?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290756,Thank you.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290757,"Okay, so here we're going to get a little abstruse.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290758,"Okay, so the way that this works is that the way we define Sabbath in Jewish law is we try to figure out what you were not allowed to do in building the tabernacle.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290759,"Okay, so get ready.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290760,"In the book of Exodus, there's a long description of what it took to build the tabernacle.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290761,What we know is that you were not allowed to build the tabernacle.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290762,You're not allowed to wreck the tabernacle on Sabbath.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290763,"So what that means is that when we were trying to figure out what exactly you can and cannot do on Sabbath, what we do is what we do.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290764,"We look at the so-called 39 malachot, right?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290765,39 activities.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290766,And those 39 activities are things that you couldn't do in building the tabernacle.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290767,"And so the idea is that you're not allowed to do them when you are on a normal Sabbath, because that's the way we're learning what you can do and what you can't do when it comes to Sabbath.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290768,And the commandment to keep the Sabbath is given in Exodus or to guard the Sabbath is given in Exodus.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290769,And so we're taking the same book and we're figuring out exactly what that means.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290770,So those rules include things ranging from digging to kindling a fire.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290771,So there's a big sort of early 20th century debate about the use of electricity.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290772,Is it the equivalent of kindling a fire?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290773,"Therefore, you're not allowed to actually turn on and off lights.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290774,"So you can actually preset lights on the Sabbath, right?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290775,You set it before the Sabbath and it goes on and off automatically.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290776,"You're not actually doing that, right?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290777,That would be one way of doing it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290778,You can leave lights on throughout the Sabbath.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290779,You can't flip it off because that's like putting out a fire.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290780,You're not allowed to do that on Sabbath.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290781,The other theory with regard to electricity is that you're not allowed to build on the Sabbath.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290782,"And there's a piece of abstruse reasoning that says that this is a form of, in Hebrew, it's called bonah, of building.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290783,"And when you complete a circuit, that is a form of building.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290784,So that is the reason for that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290785,"When it comes to driving a car, you're actively kindling a fire.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290786,"When you use an internal combustion engine, you're kindling a fire.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290787,"Now, when it comes to electric cars, you run into the same issues as with the light.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290788,"Is this the equivalent of either a shreit fire or is it the equivalent of bonah, like building a circuit?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290789,"Again, Jewish law is an attempt to reify in the world what God wants of you.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290790,And it gets into really kind of nook and cranny areas of tremendous specificity.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290791,"And it sounds wild, but the reality is that if you actually think that God cares about what you do, you try to suss out as best you can from the rules that are available to you how exactly to act in your daily life.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290792,So those are the reasons for that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290793,"Mike Palmer says, I watch your show just about every day.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290794,I appreciate all you do as well as others there at DW.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290795,I've been hearing the word anti-Semitic a lot in the last three years.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290796,I've noticed something strange about how it's pronounced.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290797,"Everyone who uses the word seems to pronounce it anti-Semitic, but it's clearly anti-Semitic.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290798,"I've even looked up the actual pronunciation, which is anti-Semitic.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290799,I've never heard anyone actually pronounce it as it's spelled.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290800,"Now, it will bother you.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290801,I'd be very interested in hearing your thoughts.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290802,I have no idea.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290803,I have no idea.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290804,I got nothing for you.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290805,I don't know.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290806,I think the term is out of date anyway.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290807,I think we should just use the term Jew hatred.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290808,So that's what it is.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290809,"Matt says, hey, Ben, long time listener.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290810,Love the show.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290811,My wife and I are expecting our first child in the next two weeks.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290812,Any advice for us as new parents?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290813,"Yeah, you should use, as brand new parents, you should use the so-called five S's.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290814,"So that would be like soothing, swaddling.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290815,This is to calm a crying baby.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290816,Babies like to cry a lot.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290817,So this is Harvey Karp.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290818,"Okay, so here's a quick primer.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290819,Harvey Karp is a doctor who figured out kind of ways to stop your baby from crying.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290820,Swaddling.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290821,Put the baby on their side or their stomach while they're awake.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290822,You can't let a baby sleep on its stomach.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290823,That creates SIDS risk.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290824,Shushing the baby.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290825,"You go to the baby's ear and go, shh.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290826,And it sounds real weird.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290827,But the reason you're doing that is that's what it actually sounds like in vitro.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290828,Swinging the baby.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290829,That doesn't mean like you grab them by the feet.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290830,So it means that you like swing them side to side.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290831,They really like that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290832,That's why babies like the baby swings.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290833,And you give them like a pacifier.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290834,That's how you see the baby.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290835,"And then when they get a little bit older, there are all sorts of theories about how to sleep train.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290836,My wife and I are of the cry it out mentality.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290837,Which there's some people who will like go in for five minutes and go out.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290838,"Oh my God, it's going to create lifelong trauma.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290839,"If you let the baby cry for too long, we disagree.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290840,"The way that we've always done it is when the baby hits an age, usually it's about, I don't know, six months, five months.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290841,"When the baby's able to sleep train, you just let them cry it out.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290842,And then they go to sleep.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290843,And they go to sleep at a regular time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2290844,My kids have been really great sleepers ever since they were very young.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
