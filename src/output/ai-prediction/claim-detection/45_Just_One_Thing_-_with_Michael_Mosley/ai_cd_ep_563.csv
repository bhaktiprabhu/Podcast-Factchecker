2465332,"Wow, the turmeric powder's got a wonderfully bright colour and quite a strong aroma as well.",FALSE,FALSE
2465333,"Now, turmeric is a close relative of ginger and if you buy turmeric fresh, turmeric has a similar knobbly, root-like look, but inside turmeric's this vibrant yellow-orange.",TRUE,TRUE
2465334,The colour comes from a substance within turmeric called curcumin and a substance within it called curcumin's the compound scientists think is the key to turmeric's benefits for the brain and body.,TRUE,TRUE
2465335,"Turmeric has been widely used for millennia in many parts of the world's, especially in Southeast Asia, not just for cooking but also as medicine and there is new research showing Turmeric could be especially beneficial for some types of pain.",TRUE,TRUE

2465337,"I'm speaking to Yushi, an office worker.",TRUE,FALSE
2465338,"Let's see if spicing up Yushi, an office worker's life with turmeric is just one thing Yushi, an office worker'd like to do.",FALSE,FALSE
2465339,Hi there.,FALSE,FALSE
2465340,Hello.,FALSE,FALSE
2465341,"Now, first of all, do Yushi, an office worker enjoy cooking?",FALSE,FALSE
2465342,"Yushi, an office worker do enjoy cooking",FALSE,FALSE
2465343,"Yushi, an office worker do enjoy cooking but Yushi, an office worker wish Yushi, an office worker had a bit more time to try different recipes.",FALSE,FALSE
2465344,"Right, and have Yushi, an office worker ever cooked with turmeric before?",FALSE,FALSE
2465345,"Yushi, an office worker haven't actually.",TRUE,FALSE
2465346,"Yushi, an office worker've been wanting to incorporate more spices in Yushi, an office worker's cooking.",TRUE,FALSE
2465347,"Turmeric, as you may well know, is widely used in curries",TRUE,TRUE
2465348,"Turmeric, as you may well know, is widely used in curries but it's also delicious in scrambled eggs, soups and yogurts or a turmeric pancake.",FALSE,FALSE
2465349,"What Yushi, an office worker want you to do is to add one teaspoon a day to your cooking, could be breakfast, lunch or supper, however you want to do it, but one teaspoon a day.",FALSE,FALSE
2465350,"Do Yushi, an office worker think Yushi, an office worker can manage that?",FALSE,FALSE
2465351,That sounds okay.,FALSE,FALSE
2465352,"Yeah, Yushi, an office worker'm definitely up for giving it a go.",FALSE,FALSE
2465353,Be aware that it is a very bright yellow colour and it can stain.,FALSE,FALSE
2465354,That sounds good.,FALSE,FALSE
2465355,Thanks for the heads up.,FALSE,FALSE
2465356,"I've asked Yushi, an office worker to spice things up with turmeric because turmeric not only adds colour and flavouring to food, turmeric's also been linked to some surprising health claims, from boosting attention and working memory to improving asthma and eczema.",TRUE,TRUE
2465357,The link between turmeric and health is nothing new.,FALSE,TRUE
2465358,turmeric's been used in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years to alleviate liver problems and digestive ailments.,TRUE,TRUE
2465359,"Over the last couple of decades or so, scientific research into turmeric and in particular into its active ingredient curcumin has exploded, with lots of studies exploring the health effects of turmeric.",TRUE,TRUE
2465360,And some of the findings have been impressive.,FALSE,FALSE
2465361,Let's start with the brain.,FALSE,FALSE
2465362,"A Singaporean study in 2022, following 2,700 older people for nearly five years, found those who ate a lot of turmeric-rich curries, like korma, kept those who ate a lot of turmeric-rich curries, like korma's brains in better shape, when measured for things like working memory and problem-solving, than those who didn't.",TRUE,TRUE
2465363,"The authors suggest that it's the curcumin, which is a polyphenol in the turmeric, which is responsible for these positive effects.",TRUE,TRUE
2465364,"Now, a big problem with curcumin is that normally very little of curcumin gets absorbed.",FALSE,TRUE
2465365,"So The authors think that one of the reasons why The authors saw such good results in The authors's study is because when you consume curcumin with fat and certain spices, this helps your body to absorb more of curcumin.",TRUE,FALSE
2465366,It's a great excuse to add curcumin to curry.,FALSE,FALSE
2465367,"And if you don't fancy curry, then you might consider a curcumin supplement.",FALSE,FALSE
2465368,"In an Australian study where they gave curcumin in pill form to 80 older individuals, they found that compared to placebo, taking curcumin in pill form improved working memory and reduced fatigue.",TRUE,TRUE
2465369,One way curcumin in pill form might be working is by reducing inflammation.,FALSE,TRUE
2465370,"In a recent Japanese study where overweight but otherwise healthy participants were randomly allocated to placebo or curcumin extract, they found those taking curcumin extract had lower levels of an inflammatory marker in the blood called C-reactive protein.",TRUE,TRUE
2465371,"And as we'll discover in a moment, it appears turmeric can also relieve pain.",FALSE,TRUE
2465372,I'll be delving into that with an expert shortly.,FALSE,FALSE
2465373,"But first, let's check in with Yushi, an office worker.",FALSE,FALSE
2465374,The first recipe I tried was the chicken korma and the taste was really good overall.,TRUE,FALSE
2465375,It was a nice bright yellow colour.,FALSE,FALSE
2465376,It did stain things.,FALSE,FALSE
2465377,The wooden spoon that I use for cooking is now just permanently yellow.,TRUE,FALSE
2465378,"The challenges really inspired Yushi, an office worker to be a bit more adventurous with the food that Yushi, an office worker make.",FALSE,FALSE
2465379,Yushi'm looking forward to the rest of the week.,FALSE,FALSE
2465380,"We'll catch up with Yushi, an office worker at the end of the week and see if Yushi, an office worker can find some tasty ways to incorporate turmeric into Yushi, an office worker's diet.",FALSE,FALSE
2465381,"But now to get the lowdown on turmeric, I'm speaking to Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia.",TRUE,FALSE
2465382,G'day.,FALSE,FALSE
2465383,"Good day, Michael.",FALSE,FALSE
2465384,"Now, what would Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia say are the main benefits of turmeric?",FALSE,FALSE
2465385,"Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, that is a traditional Indian medicine, as well as traditional Chinese medicine.",TRUE,TRUE
2465386,"But only recently, people have identified the active components such as the curcumin.",TRUE,TRUE
2465387,So turmeric has been mainly known as an anti-inflammatory agent.,TRUE,TRUE
2465388,It is also known to be an antioxidant.,FALSE,FALSE
2465389,"Therefore, it can be useful for chronic conditions.",FALSE,FALSE
2465390,It's also got antifungal properties and some wound healing properties.,FALSE,FALSE
2465391,So what not?,FALSE,FALSE
2465392,It's got many properties.,TRUE,FALSE
2465393,"Now, Michael know you have done clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis.",TRUE,TRUE
2465394,Can Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia tell Michael about clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis?,TRUE,FALSE
2465395,So clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis involved 70 patients.,TRUE,TRUE
2465396,So Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia selected patients based on pain as well as based on the joint inflammation.,TRUE,TRUE
2465397,So Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia randomized 35 people into placebo group and 35 people into the active group who received the turmeric extract.,TRUE,TRUE
2465398,And then Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia followed 70 patients over 12 weeks.,TRUE,TRUE
2465399,And Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia found that the participants who were taking the turmeric extract had relief in pain compared to placebo group.,TRUE,TRUE
2465400,"Obviously, both placebo and treatment group both reduced the knee pain.",TRUE,FALSE
2465401,But treatment group had a further reduction compared to placebo group.,TRUE,FALSE
2465402,Right.,FALSE,FALSE
2465403,"Because we know the placebo effect is very powerful, particularly in pain.",FALSE,FALSE
2465404,"So oddly enough, you would actually have to be quite impressive to outdo placebo in this context.",FALSE,FALSE
2465405,And did it affect the amount of pain medication 35 people into the active group who received the turmeric extract were taking?,TRUE,FALSE
2465406,"Yeah, that's one of the interesting or secondary outcomes of clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis was that there was a reduction in the number of medications which 70 patients were taking for 70 patients's knee pain.",TRUE,TRUE
2465407,So how does turmeric compare to a standard painkiller like ibuprofen?,FALSE,FALSE
2465408,"In our trial, we did not really compare turmeric extract with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.",TRUE,TRUE
2465409,"However, we can indirectly compare the effect size of the treatment.",FALSE,FALSE
2465410,That means we found a modest effect of the treatment compared to placebo.,TRUE,FALSE
2465411,"And similarly, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen have got only a modest effect.",TRUE,TRUE
2465412,-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen seems to have a lot of contraindications.,TRUE,TRUE
2465413,That means Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen cannot be taken in older patients.,TRUE,TRUE
2465414,And a lot of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen have more severe adverse events such as the gastrointestinal bleeding or cardiovascular events.,TRUE,TRUE
2465415,"So compared to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen, there seems to be no adverse event for turmeric extract.",TRUE,FALSE
2465416,Right.,FALSE,FALSE
2465417,Did you also see an anti-inflammatory effect?,FALSE,FALSE
2465418,Did 70 patients actually have less inflammation in the joint?,TRUE,FALSE
2465419,the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia did not find a significant difference in local inflammation.,TRUE,TRUE
2465420,And the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia also tested whether the turmeric consumption led to a reduction in the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.,TRUE,TRUE
2465421,And an expert did not find a significant effect of the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.,TRUE,TRUE
2465422,Because of the treatment of turmeric.,FALSE,FALSE
2465423,So it's possible there is something else going on.,FALSE,FALSE
2465424,That turmeric is not necessarily acting by reducing inflammation.,FALSE,TRUE
2465425,What do Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia think that something else might be?,FALSE,FALSE
2465426,So there is possibly other mechanisms that could have explained the reduction in pain.,FALSE,FALSE
2465427,Some studies suggest that turmeric might have an effect in the gut-brain axis that turmeric extracts.,TRUE,TRUE
2465428,Especially the curcumin can actually improve a certain type of bacterial colony which reduces the inflammation.,FALSE,TRUE
2465429,So there is plenty of other evidence to say that turmeric can reduce inflammation in a systemic level and which is evidenced in the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream as well.,TRUE,TRUE
2465430,OK.,FALSE,FALSE
2465431,Now you are obviously focusing on osteoarthritis which is an inflammatory condition in the knee.,FALSE,FALSE
2465432,Do Michael think it could be beneficial for other types of pain?,FALSE,FALSE
2465433,So what we have found that it's been effective for acute pain as well.,FALSE,FALSE
2465434,It's not just for the chronic conditions as well.,FALSE,FALSE
2465435,But it's for normal healthy people.,FALSE,FALSE
2465436,It can be used to reduce the pain.,FALSE,FALSE
2465437,Although it still needs more research in this area.,FALSE,FALSE
2465438,"If people do want to boost people's turmeric consumption, what's the best way of doing so?",FALSE,FALSE
2465439,So if people want to increase the active component in the turmeric such as the curcumin in people's body.,FALSE,FALSE
2465440,The best way to do it is to combine the turmeric with some pepper because piperine seems to increase the bioavailability that means the increased absorption of curcumin in the body.,FALSE,TRUE
2465441,The other option is fatty food seems to increase the bioavailability of curcumin.,FALSE,TRUE
2465442,Obviously I've got an Indian heritage so I follow some of the Indian cuisine.,FALSE,FALSE
2465443,So I pour oil first and then I put turmeric powder in oil.,FALSE,FALSE
2465444,So it's good for taste and it's going to increase the bioavailability.,FALSE,FALSE
2465445,"Right, that's the science.",FALSE,FALSE
2465446,Now let's check in one more time with Yushi to see how Yushi's getting on with turmeric.,FALSE,FALSE
2465447,It's the end of the week.,FALSE,FALSE
2465448,The turmeric ended up tasting a lot nicer than I expected.,FALSE,FALSE
2465449,And I surprised myself with the range of different dishes I was able to incorporate turmeric into.,FALSE,FALSE
2465450,The turmeric pancakes were really delicious.,FALSE,FALSE
2465451,The turmeric gave The turmeric pancakes a really warm flavour.,FALSE,FALSE
2465452,The turmeric worked quite well with savoury toppings.,TRUE,FALSE
2465453,Yushi'll definitely be making the curry again.,FALSE,FALSE
2465454,Overall Yushi found the challenge a great success.,FALSE,FALSE
2465455,Yushi really enjoyed the challenge.,FALSE,FALSE
2465456,I'm really glad to hear that Yushi has enjoyed Yushi's challenge and I've been adding more turmeric to my diet and I've discovered something novel which I do enjoy and something novel which I do enjoy is having turmeric as a latte.,FALSE,FALSE
2465457,Now I've got some milk here and I'm going to add some milk to my milk frother.,FALSE,FALSE
2465458,There we go.,FALSE,FALSE
2465459,Nice and frost up.,FALSE,FALSE
2465460,I'm adding a nice teaspoon of turmeric and then giving it a good old stir.,FALSE,FALSE
2465461,And it's certainly a wonderfully orange colour.,FALSE,FALSE
2465462,And the advantage of using milk is the fat means that I'm going to absorb more of the good stuff as well.,FALSE,FALSE
2465463,It's also delicious.,FALSE,FALSE
2465464,"So if you're looking for an excuse to have a delicious hot drink or perhaps that curry you've been craving, here it is.",FALSE,FALSE
2465465,Add in some turmeric.,FALSE,FALSE
2465466,It could boost your brain and take away your pain.,FALSE,FALSE
