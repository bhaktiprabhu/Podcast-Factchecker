2465893,"Although some bacteria in your mouth are helpful, the ones that cause gum disease can affect your whole body, causing damage in organs far away from your mouth.",FALSE,True
2465894,"For example, keeping your gums in good shape can benefit your heart.",FALSE,True
2465895,"According to a huge study conducted on over 10,000 men and women from the Scottish Health Survey, people who brush people who brush their teeth twice a day's teeth twice a day have lower rates of heart disease than those who brush once a day or less.",TRUE,True
2465896,Why?,FALSE,False
2465897,"Well, one suggestion is that when bacteria from your mouth leak into your blood, leak activates an immune response.",FALSE,True
2465898,"In the short term, that can be helpful.",FALSE,False
2465899,"But if it continues, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which damages the heart.",FALSE,True

2465907,mine'll be speaking to a scientist about this surprising mouth-brain connection in a moment.,FALSE,False
2465908,"But first, let's check in with Laurie from North Wales to see how Laurie from North Wales's getting on with the challenge.",FALSE,False
2465909,"So Laurie from North Wales'm about halfway through the week and Laurie from North Wales's teeth look amazing, the best my teeth've looked in a long time.",FALSE,False
2465910,Laurie from North Wales'm enjoying doing it in the evenings.,FALSE,False
2465911,It feels like self-care.,FALSE,False

2465913,"Lori've stuck to cleaning Lori's teeth twice a day, every single day.",FALSE,False
2465914,"It's actually helped Lori with the snacking, because obviously once Lori've done Lori's teeth, Lori then end up not snacking in the evening, so that's been great.",FALSE,False
2465915,"So yeah, really enjoying the challenge and really pleased with how the challenge's going.",FALSE,False

2465919,Good day.,FALSE,False
2465920,Good day.,FALSE,False
2465921,What exactly is gum disease?,FALSE,False
2465922,gum disease is formed by bacteria in the mouth.,TRUE,True

2465925,"Now obviously gum disease is bad for your mouth, but how does gum disease affect the rest of your body?",FALSE,False
2465926,So there is this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums.,FALSE,True
2465927,"Once this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums goes into the bloodstream, this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums can go to different organs all over the body.",FALSE,True
2465928,"And we do know things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke're all related to periodontal disease or gum disease.",TRUE,True
2465929,"So things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke can also cross the blood-brain barrier and get into your brain.",FALSE,True
2465930,"And that is Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's area of research, is that right?",FALSE,False
2465931,The mouth-brain connection.,FALSE,False
2465932,Yes.,FALSE,False
2465933,"So initially we obtained a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and we examined Alzheimer's disease brains and non-Alzheimer's disease brains in the laboratory and looking for signatures of DNA from bacteria in the mouth, as well as any proteins that might be associated with bacteria in the mouth.",TRUE,False
2465934,And we found signatures of DNA from these bacteria from the gum were exclusively within the Alzheimer's disease brains and not in the non-Alzheimer's control brains.,TRUE,True
2465935,"So you're looking at a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients, it was only in the Alzheimer's disease's patients that you actually found the presence of these bacteria from the gum?",TRUE,False
2465936,That's correct.,FALSE,False
2465937,"That must have been an exciting moment, also slightly disturbing.",FALSE,False
2465938,"The idea that you can go from the mouth to the brain to dementia is a very big step, isn't it?",FALSE,False
2465939,Absolutely.,FALSE,False
2465940,"As soon as we published our first study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, we were constantly being asked, well, can you show us that these bacteria from the gum actually get to the brain?",FALSE,True
2465941,It's incredible.,FALSE,False
2465942,So the next study we conducted was in collaboration with the University of Florida.,TRUE,False
2465943,So what the University of Florida did was the University of Florida caused periodontal disease experimentally in mice and what we found was that bacteria had entered the brains of mice.,TRUE,True
2465944,Clearly the message is that oral health is unbelievably important for your body and your and what are the best ways of looking after your teeth and your mouth generally?,FALSE,False
2465945,What are Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's top tips?,FALSE,False
2465946,Top tips are obviously clean your mouth twice a day at least for two minutes each time.,FALSE,False
2465947,"First thing in the morning, last thing at night.",FALSE,False
2465948,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush it,FALSE,False
2465949,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush fluoride toothpaste and then you can let some of fluoride toothpaste linger on into your teeth and gums so that fluoride toothpaste has the added protection for a little bit longer to act on the teeth.,FALSE,False
2465950,So I'm told spit but don't rinse.,FALSE,False
2465951,What about the tongue?,FALSE,False
2465952,Do you do anything with your tongue?,FALSE,False
2465953,"Well, our research has actually shown the tongue gets very dirty.",FALSE,False
2465954,That was a surprise.,FALSE,False
2465955,"Definitely, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think it's important to clean the tongue.",TRUE,True
2465956,What do Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think about mouthwashes?,FALSE,False
2465957,Good or bad?,FALSE,False
2465958,"Well, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think mouthwashes have mouthwashes's place.",TRUE,False
2465959,We should really go by when the dentist has recommended mouthwashes's use and for how long.,FALSE,False
2465960,"Alternatively, if you feel that you want to use a mouthwash then Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry would certainly make sure that you understand the instructions on a mouthwash.",FALSE,False
2465961,So brush for two minutes including your tongue and just spit.,FALSE,False
2465962,Don't rinse your mouth afterwards.,FALSE,False
2465963,Most of us would also benefit from flossing or using interdental brushes before we brush our teeth.,FALSE,False
2465964,A study of dental students in Iran found that flossing before rather than after removed the most plaque.,TRUE,True
2465965,Another tip from the British Dental Association is to brush before breakfast and to wait a full hour after your evening meal to brush again.,FALSE,True
2465966,"And that's because eating creates acid in the mouth, weakening your enamel.",FALSE,False
2465967,Brushing too soon after a meal can actually damage your teeth.,FALSE,True
2465968,So there we go.,FALSE,False
2465969,Let's check in with Lurie one final time.,FALSE,False
2465970,Let's find out if Lurie has been able to stick to Lurie's new oral hygiene routine.,FALSE,False

2465972,Lurie've really surprised Lurie by how relaxing Lurie found the interdental brushes.,FALSE,False
2465973,Aesthetically the task that I was given's been brilliant.,FALSE,False
2465974,Lurie's teeth have never looked this good.,FALSE,False
2465975,"People have even commented on how white My teeth are, which has never happened before.",FALSE,False
2465976,"But it's also really good to know that Lurie am doing something that could prevent dementia, could reduce Lurie's chance of getting heart disease.",TRUE,False
2465977,So it's definitely a win-win and definitely something that Lurie will continue doing as we go forward.,FALSE,False
2465978,I'm delighted to hear that Lurie will be sticking with Lurie's new routine.,FALSE,False
2465979,I've also been paying particular attention to my dental hygiene the week.,FALSE,False
2465980,"I already regularly flossed and brushed my teeth before the task that I was given, but since Lurie started using those plaque disclosing tablets, I've begun to focus on areas where I obviously hadn't been that thorough.",FALSE,False
2465981,"I do believe that doing this will not only help me keep my teeth for as long as possible, but also offer health benefits beyond my mouth.",FALSE,False
2465982,"Floss or use an interdental brush, then apply the electric toothbrush and your gums, your heart and your brain will thank you.",FALSE,False
2465983,So that's it.,FALSE,False

2465990,Young people are so concerned about the state of the earth and then Young people are labelled as hysterical.,FALSE,False
2465991,"I'm Matthew Side and in the new season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast, Sideways, I'd like to tell you stories of seeing the world differently and explore the ideas that shape our lives.",FALSE,False
