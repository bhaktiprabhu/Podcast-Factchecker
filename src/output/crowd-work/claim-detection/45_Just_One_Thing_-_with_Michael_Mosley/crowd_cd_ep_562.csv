2465162,"In one study, people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions's thoughts on three separate occasions not only found that doing so improved the quality of people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions's sleep, but it also reduced how often people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions had negative thoughts.",FALSE
2465163,"Of course, if you've just experienced a significant trauma or are feeling completely overwhelmed, it would be advisable to go to your GP or another health professional.",FALSE

2465174,I'll be speaking to Professor James Pennebaker later in the programme.,FALSE
2465175,"First, let's find out how Julie is getting on with Julie's writing challenge.",FALSE
2465176,I've just written my first expressive writing.,FALSE
2465177,It surprised Julie how much Julie've actually written and Julie have gone over the 15 minutes and didn't realise.,FALSE
2465178,Julie'm quite surprised how much Julie have written and how frank and honest it actually looks as well.,FALSE
2465179,Julie don't usually write during the day.,FALSE
2465180,Usually Julie'm typing at a computer screen or using Julie's mobile phone so to actually pick up a pen was actually quite nice and the words just did seem to flow.,FALSE
2465181,"Wow, I'm glad that Julie got out Julie's pen and wrote those thoughts away.",FALSE
2465182,We'll catch up with Julie again at the end of the week and see if Julie's still enjoying writing enough to make it just one thing Julie'll keep up.,FALSE
2465183,"But now to find out more about why expressive writing is so powerful, I'm speaking to Professor James Pennebaker.",FALSE
2465184,"Professor James Pennebaker, tell me about that first study.",FALSE
2465185,"I was curious if writing about upsetting topics that people had kept secret, if that could be beneficial.",FALSE
2465186,"So that first study, we brought people in the lab one at a time.",FALSE
2465187,We gave people instructions to write about people's deepest thoughts and feelings about this upsetting experience that people hadn't talked much with others about.,FALSE
2465188,people would write for 15 minutes and then people'd come back the next day.,FALSE
2465189,We had another group running at the same time.,FALSE
2465190,another group were asked to write about superficial topics.,FALSE
2465191,And then we simply just tracked how often people went to the doctor over the next several months.,FALSE
2465192,And what we found was that people who wrote about this upsetting experience that they hadn't talked much with others about ended up going to the doctor at far lower rates than people in our control conditions.,FALSE
2465193,Wow.,FALSE
2465194,Did people who wrote about these traumatic experience share what people who wrote about these traumatic experience were writing with others or was it intended to remain a secret but written down?,FALSE
2465195,We told people who wrote about these traumatic experience that we wanted to keep what people who wrote about these traumatic experience'd written and we would never connect it with who people who wrote about these traumatic experience were.,FALSE
2465196,people who wrote about these traumatic experience didn't read it to us or anybody else.,FALSE
2465197,"Right, because in standard therapy, you're supposed to talk it out.",FALSE
2465198,"But in this case, it was enough just to write it down.",FALSE
2465199,And people who wrote about these traumatic experience were asked to write about some of the most traumatic experiences of people who wrote about these traumatic experience's lives.,FALSE
2465200,Did it have to be a major trauma to work?,FALSE
2465201,No.,FALSE
2465202,"What Professor James Pennebaker usually ask people to do is, Professor James Pennebaker want people to write about any experience that you're worried about that keeps recurring in people's mind.",FALSE
2465203,"So, do Professor James Pennebaker think it's that expressive writing in some ways helping clear your mind?",FALSE
2465204,"You know, there was a couple of really interesting studies looking at this several years ago.",FALSE
2465205,There's a phenomenon called working memory.,FALSE
2465206,working memory is how your mind is constantly thinking about things.,FALSE
2465207,"And if you're under stress, you're not able to take in other information.",FALSE
2465208,You're more forgetful.,FALSE
2465209,You don't sleep as well.,FALSE
2465210,What these researchers found was that expressive writing increased a phenomenon called working memory.,FALSE
2465211,People were now able to think more clearly.,FALSE
2465212,People did better at university in terms of People's grades.,FALSE
2465213,People slept better.,FALSE
2465214,"We know that when somebody is stressed and they're obsessing about things, their heart beats faster, their immune system is suppressed.",FALSE
2465215,"And when a person writes about an upsetting experience, you find certain enhancements in immune activity that the immune system is working more efficiently.",FALSE
2465216,Wow.,FALSE
2465217,Can you tell me what you think the mechanism is?,FALSE
2465218,Did the mechanism lead to measurable changes in the body?,FALSE
2465219,So there have been several studies looking at this.,FALSE
2465220,several studies looking at this do what's called a punch biopsy.,FALSE
2465221,a punch biopsy's a small five millimeter punch in your skin.,FALSE
2465222,And several studies looking at this look and see how long it takes to heal.,FALSE
2465223,And what several studies looking at this do in several studies looking at this is several studies looking at this have people write about emotional upheavals in the days prior to a punch biopsy.,FALSE
2465224,"And with expressive writing, people heal more quickly than if people're writing about superficial topics.",FALSE
2465225,And what's particularly intriguing is several studies looking at this're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,FALSE
2465226,"But several studies looking at this're also finding these changes with these more elegant immune markers, hormones and peptides that are associated with the healing process itself.",FALSE
2465227,How big are several studies looking at this?,FALSE
2465228,"I mean, are several studies looking at this convincing?",FALSE
2465229,Part of it is you have to look at how many studies have been done.,FALSE
2465230,There have been a couple of thousand studies.,FALSE
2465231,"In most of the studies, you find improvements in physical health.",FALSE
2465232,"But the effects are, the effects are modest.",FALSE
2465233,"What's so striking about this is that we're only asking them to write, say, 15 minutes a day for three or four days.",FALSE
2465234,"As an intervention, it's free, it's fast, it's easy.",FALSE
2465235,Does this kind of writing also benefit your social life?,FALSE
2465236,"Yes, this kind of writing does.",FALSE
2465237,"What we found was that people who wrote about this upsetting experience, people who wrote about this upsetting experience's social behaviors changed.",FALSE
2465238,"A month later, people who wrote about this upsetting experience were talking more with others.",FALSE
2465239,people who wrote about this upsetting experience were more socially engaged.,FALSE
2465240,people who wrote about this upsetting experience laughed more.,FALSE
2465241,"One reason that this can be so powerful is that when you write, you get these upsetting experiences out of your mind.",FALSE
2465242,You're now able to connect with other people better.,FALSE
2465243,You're able to listen to other people.,FALSE
2465244,You're able to be a better friend.,FALSE
2465245,Right.,FALSE
2465246,"So if I want to undertake this kind of writing, can you talk me through how I start?",FALSE
2465247,"First of all, I'm not here to sell you a bona fide, copyrighted system.",FALSE
2465248,Experiment and see what works best for you.,FALSE
2465249,Set aside three or four days.,FALSE
2465250,Find 10 or 15 minutes and just sit down and write.,FALSE
2465251,And the only rule I have is to write continuously.,FALSE
2465252,Don't worry about grammar or sentence structure or spelling.,FALSE
2465253,"And in fact, plan to throw it away afterwards.",FALSE
2465254,I discovered a method several years ago that I call finger writing.,FALSE
2465255,Just writing with my finger in the air.,FALSE
2465256,finger writing also works quite well.,FALSE
2465257,"And if after two or three days you find that you're not benefiting from finger writing at all, then stop writing.",FALSE
2465258,Do something else.,FALSE
2465259,"You know, go jogging.",FALSE
2465260,"This is not one true way, but it's a remarkably effective system.",FALSE
2465261,Right.,FALSE
2465262,That's the science.,FALSE
2465263,Time to check in with Julie.,FALSE
2465264,Let's find out if expressive writing is something Julie'll carry on with.,FALSE
2465265,I really enjoyed the three sessions.,FALSE
2465266,Julie did find it was more beneficial to write on an evening before bedtime.,FALSE
2465267,It just felt as though Julie was able to just clear Julie's mind and Julie's thoughts.,FALSE
2465268,"And Julie did actually have an uninterrupted sleep that evening, which was great.",FALSE
2465269,"Julie really enjoyed the part where Julie was able to just spend some time by Julie and download Julie's thoughts and feelings and just create some space, really.",FALSE
2465270,Julie've actually signed up for a creative writing course.,FALSE
2465271,"So yeah, really enjoyed it",FALSE
2465272,"So yeah, really enjoyed expressive writing and Julie will be taking expressive writing forward.",FALSE
2465273,I am really glad to hear that Julie has got so much out of Julie's writing.,FALSE
2465274,And I've been doing it all week,FALSE
2465275,And I've been doing expressive writing all week and I do think expressive writing's made a difference.,FALSE
2465276,Perhaps helped Julie's sleep a bit.,FALSE
2465277,Today I'm trying Professor Pennebaker's finger writing method.,FALSE
2465278,I've decided to come to my local woods and I'm here to wave my finger in the air.,FALSE
2465279,It's always nice to have an excuse to come outside.,FALSE
2465280,"If you haven't heard it yet, check out our Green Spaces episode from Series 1 on BBC Sounds.",FALSE
2465281,"I do think taking up something like expressive writing can be really worth it, especially if you're a bit anxious and you don't need a computer or pen to do expressive writing and your relationships, your brain and your immune system could benefit.",FALSE
2465282,So that's it.,FALSE
