And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,"For years, the US government largely ignored reports of mysterious flying objects seen moving through restricted military airspace but it is now slowly beginning to acknowledge that UFOs, which the Pentagon refers to as unidentified aerial phenomena, are real. While it is certainly premature to speculate as to whether these flying objects come from another world, the US military has recently confirmed the authenticity of several videos and images showing encounters with unidentified flying objects – fueling questions about what the Pentagon knows about such incidents and others like them.

Next month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies are scheduled to deliver unclassified reports on UFOs to Congress.

He says he resigned from the Defense Department in 2017 in protest over the secrecy surrounding the program and the internal opposition to funding it. But in reality, interest in the Pentagon’s handling of reported unidentified flying objects has more to do with ensuring any potential national security implications are being taken seriously – whether they are of this world or not.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/17/politics/ufo-pentagon-explainer/index.html,SUPPORTS
And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,"Furthering the growing interest in unidentified flying objects, or what the US government refers to as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), the Department of Defense confirmed on Thursday that recently leaked photos and videos of UFOs were legitimate and taken by navy personnel. Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed to CNN that images and footage of a blinking triangular object in the sky, along with other UAPs that were categorized as a “sphere”, “acorn” and “metallic blimp”, were taken by navy personnel in 2019. UFO report details ‘difficult to explain’ sightings, says US ex-intelligence director ... Last April, the Pentagon released three videos of UAPs taken in 2004 and 2015 that included audio of pilots amazed at the speed of the objects they were seeing. “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/16/pentagon-ufos-leaked-photos-uap,SUPPORTS
And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,"It also faces the criticism that seven decades after UFOs first appeared on the radar, it ought to know what they are. The new Pentagon report doesn’t compel us to accept the reality of alien visitation. But it does compel us to take UFOs seriously. The Pentagon’s UAP task force represents an abrupt reversal of this longstanding organisational policy. UFO reports, made primarily by military personnel, are no longer pollutants. They are now important data with national security implications. UFO reports, made primarily by military personnel, are no longer pollutants. They are now important data with national security implications. That said, they do still represent “uncomfortable knowledge”. As the late Oxford University anthropologist Steve Rayner observed, knowledge can be “uncomfortable” for institutions in two ways. First, Rayner said, “acknowledging potential information by admitting it to the realm of what is ‘known’ may undermine the organisational principles of a society or organisation”.",https://theconversation.com/pentagon-report-says-ufos-cant-be-explained-and-this-admission-is-a-big-deal-161806,SUPPORTS
And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,"It’s real, the Pentagon said, including links so the curious could download the footage for themselves. The Department of Defense confirmed what seekers of extraterrestrial life have long hoped to be true: They’re real. On Monday, the Pentagon released three Navy videos that have driven speculation about unidentified flying objects for years, saying it meant to “clear up any misconceptions” about whether the unclassified footage was real or complete.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/pentagon-ufo-videos.html,SUPPORTS
And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,"No, the Pentagon doesn’t know what they are. There’s no evidence that the objects were sent by space aliens, but the report, mandated by Congress as part of the 2021 National Intelligence Authorization Act, confirms that the sightings remain “unidentified.” · But no one in the intelligence community uses the term UFO anymore. Last year, when the Pentagon initially confirmed the leaked UAP incidents were indeed encounters with unidentified objects, the witnesses involved in the sightings went from the fringe to the mainstream. The frank admissions “kind of made me and my shipmates the most well-sought-after UFO experiencers,” Voorhis says. But the ripple effects of the sighting never really went away. Officials in the Pentagon repeatedly asked her to brief people who wanted to hear her story firsthand. Since 2004, Dietrich has been requested to deliver briefings at least once a year and usually more, often enough that it became a nuisance.",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/what-the-pentagon-report-says-about-ufos,SUPPORTS
