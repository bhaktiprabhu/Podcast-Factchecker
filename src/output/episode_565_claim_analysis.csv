2465670,Or how about cleaning your teeth to give your brain a boost?,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465671,"I'm Dr Michael Moseley and this is Just One Thing, where each episode we'll explore one thing you can start doing today to improve your health or life in ways you might not expect.",Not Checkworthy,2,2,Checkworthy,False
2465672,"More about those and the sort of benefits you get from doing them in our episodes on Intelligent Exercises and Eccentric Exercises, which are both available on BBC Sounds.",Not Checkworthy,3,2,Checkworthy,False
2465673,"God, that's knackering.",Not Checkworthy,2,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465674,"But I haven't tried using weights before, and I had to borrow these from one of my sons.",Checkworthy,1,4,Not Checkworthy,False
2465675,Woo!,Not Checkworthy,1,4,Not Checkworthy,True
2465676,This is tough.,Not Checkworthy,2,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465677,"For me, when I think of weightlifting, I get this image of bodybuilders pumping huge barbells in the gym, and that really is not my style.",Not Checkworthy,3,3,Checkworthy,False
2465678,"Right, done.",Not Checkworthy,1,4,Not Checkworthy,True
2465679,"Recent evidence suggests that muscle-strengthening exercises for only a few minutes a day can confer some remarkable health benefits, boosting your immune system and even your brain.",Checkworthy,2,2,Checkworthy,True
2465680,It is counterintuitive.,Not Checkworthy,1,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465681,Just building that brawn can also build your brain and protect your white matter.,Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2465682,So how about pumping some iron?,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465683,"I'll be speaking to Jenny from Manchester, and I want to see if some strength training is just one thing she'd like to try.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465684,"Hi there, Jenny.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465685,"Hi, Michael.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465686,Good to speak to you.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465687,"Now, what kind of exercise do you normally do?",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465688,"I have to be honest, the only exercise I do is housework.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465689,So really no exercise at all apart from day-to-day activity.,Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465690,"Right, now what I'm going to ask you to do is consider weightlifting.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465691,Have you ever done weightlifting before?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465692,I've never done weightlifting in my life.,Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465693,What does it conjure up?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465694,"I'm kind of thinking big, strong, muscly men that you see on the Olympics.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465695,"Yeah, not something I would think of for me.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465696,"OK, so what I want you to do is some weight training, and you can do it without special equipment, just using your own body weight or things you probably already have around in the house.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465697,So I want you to do a combination of things.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465698,"So one is called a bicep curl, but you're going to be holding a big bottle of milk.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465699,And then I want you to do some calf raises.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465700,That's where you hold on to a countertop and you lift yourself up onto your tiptoes.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465701,"And then finally, and this is probably the most challenging, I want you to do something called weighted squats.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465702,"What you need here is you get a rucksack or a backpack, and you put some books in it, and then you do some squats.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465703,"And I want you to do three sets of these, 10 each.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465704,"And this is going to take, you know, maybe 10, maybe 15 minutes a day.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465705,"So a bit challenging, but are you up for it?",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465706,"Yeah, I'm definitely up for it.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465707,"I've asked Jenny to do a few minutes of simple strength training exercises every day for the next week, and we'll see how she gets on.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465708,"But if you'd like to do something similar, do check with your GP if you're starting a new exercise regime or have any previous injuries.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465709,"That said, there are lots of benefits of incorporating a bit of strength training into your life.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465710,"Apart from making you look more toned, building your muscles could help you live longer.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465711,"An American study found that muscle mass is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more than weight or body mass index.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465712,"Researchers followed 3,600 men and women over the age of 50 for a decade.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465713,They found that those who had more muscle mass were at a lower risk of death from all causes.,Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465714,"Lifting weights can also benefit your metabolism, your waistline and even your blood sugars.",Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465715,"That's partly because building muscle increases your insulin sensitivity, improving your ability to lower your blood sugar levels after a meal.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465716,It can even enhance your immunity.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465717,"One study looked at part of the immune system's first line of defense, cells that surround and engulf pathogens called neutrophils.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465718,"When researchers compared women who were sedentary with those who regularly did resistance training, the latter had far more active neutrophils.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465719,Strength training may even reverse ageing at a cellular level.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465720,"In one small but fascinating study, scientists asked 14 older people to do strength training twice a week for six months and then compared their muscles to that of younger adults.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465721,"They looked at the parts of the muscle cells that generate energy, the mitochondria.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465722,"Now, normally these wane with age, but the older adults who had been doing strength training boosted their mitochondrial function to levels similar to those seen in younger men and women.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465723,"And finally, strength training can do good things for your brain power.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465724,I'll be talking to an expert shortly to find out how and why building your brawn can boost your brain.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465725,"But first, let's see how Jenny is getting on.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465726,I'm on day four and finding it really helpful.,Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465727,I've been able to do the bicep curls just while I've been watching the TV or got a couple of minutes spare.,Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2465728,"Because you don't need any special equipment, I don't need to go anywhere, I don't need to get changed.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465729,It's also been easier to fit it into a really busy schedule than I'd expected and I am optimistic about completing the task.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465730,We'll catch up with Jenny at the end of the week.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465731,"But now, to get the lowdown on resistance training, I'm speaking to Dr Theresa Liu-Ambrose, who is Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia in Canada.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465732,"Hello, Dr Liu-Ambrose.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465733,Hello.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465734,"So, what are the benefits of strength training?",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465735,"Its most widely known benefits include the maintenance of your muscle mass, as well as your muscle strength and your bone health.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465736,And these are actually really important benefits as we age.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465737,"And by maintaining muscle mass, you can also reduce your risk of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465738,And these chronic conditions actually do increase your risk for developing cognitive impairment and dementia.,Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465739,"And so, this kind of segues to the benefits of strength training for brain health in terms of our cognitive performance.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465740,"So, it's been shown that it can improve your memory, as well as your more complex cognitive abilities, such as decision making.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465741,And it appears that strength training can also directly impact both your brain function and brain structure.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465742,"OK, that is surprising to most people, I would imagine, that pumping iron is good for your brain.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465743,Can you tell me about your research?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465744,We did two studies.,Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465745,"In one study, they were otherwise healthy older adults, so age 65 and older.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2465746,"And in another study, we included individuals who were also 65 years and older, but had pre-existing cognitive impairment.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465747,"And in both studies, we found that strength training had benefits for both the cognitive function, as well as metrics acquired on neuroimaging.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465748,"When you talk about improvements in cognitive function, what sort of things did you see with this group?",Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2465749,"What we found is that with strength training, people were able to remember things better.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465750,"And specifically, what we call associative memory, such that today is the first time I've met you.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465751,I've seen your face.,Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2465752,I know your name.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465753,My capacity to associate your name with your face in the future is called an associative memory capacity.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465754,"And what we found is that with strength training, this particular aspect of memory improves.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2465755,"We also found that with strength training, people had better executive functions, meaning that they were able to make the appropriate decision based on the circumstance presented to them.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465756,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2465757,"So, in this case, doing these resistance exercises not only meant that you could remember other people's names who you'd met before better as a form of memory test, but also that they made better decisions in everyday life, in a way.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2465758,Yes.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465759,And did they stick with it?,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465760,"Actually, yes.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2465761,"For one of the studies that was for 12 months, so we did train them for 12 months, but then we also followed them up for another 12 months.",Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465762,"And during that follow-up, we didn't offer exercise classes, but more just to monitor how they were doing.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465763,"And so what we did find is that a year after the study, they were more active than when they first started the study.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465764,"And as well, some of the cognitive benefits were retained, which is great news.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465765,What do you think is the mechanism?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465766,"Why do you think people who do these strength exercises, it improves their brain function?",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465767,"First, I want to acknowledge, I think there's multiple pathways by which exercise brings about benefits for cognitive and brain health.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465768,But certainly one of the main mechanisms there's evidence for is a release of what we call neurotrophic factors.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465769,"And they're kind of like peptides that essentially promote the growth of new neurons, the survival of neurons, as well as the differentiation of neurons themselves.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2465770,There's two major types.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465771,"There is a brain-derived neurotrophic factors, as well as insulin growth factor one.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465772,But I think what's really come to light in the last five years is the role of mild kinds.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465773,"It's a fairly new discovery, and they're essentially specialized hormones that are actually produced in muscles and are released when muscles contract.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465774,"Current evidence suggests once they're released, they basically travel throughout the body and go to different organs and tissues and jumpstart a variety of biochemical processes.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465775,"But in terms of the brain, what has been shown is that when you do engage in exercise, there's particular mild kinds, such as the cathispin B, that actually is released within the muscle, but crosses the blood-brain barrier and enhances neurotrophic factor production, such as BDNF.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465776,"Ah, okay.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465777,So it all ties in.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465778,"Essentially, you do a workout.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465779,"As you do that, these mild kinds are released, they go into the brain, and then they encourage the brain to produce BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465780,It helps preserve brain cells.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465781,Absolutely.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465782,And I think it's a real shift in how we think about how exercise impacts the brain as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465783,"Traditionally, we've been very focused on what's released in the brain, and we haven't really focused on peripheral mechanisms.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465784,"So I think the muscle-brain crosstalk really kind of enriches our understanding of how exercise brings about benefits and, again, the role of muscles.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465785,I do find it fascinating that we're still learning so much about how our muscles interact with our brains.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465786,Let's check in with Jenny one more time and find out if strength training is something she'll carry on with.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465787,I have really surprised myself.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465788,"I never imagined doing weights, but actually it's been fantastic.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465789,I definitely have noticed improvements in that I feel that my posture is better.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465790,I feel physically better.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465791,I feel mentally better.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465792,"And over the last few days, people have told me I'm looking better and I'm definitely going to carry on.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465793,"I'm really glad to hear Jenny has enjoyed her weightlifting week, and I've been doing it all week as well.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465794,"In fact, I'm doing it right now.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2465795,"Because I'm not a complete beginner, I'm actually doing it to failure, which means until I can't do it any longer.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465796,I think I'm reaching that point now.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465797,"Okay, other arm.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465798,I think I can feel my forearm and grip getting stronger.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465799,So I do think that lifting weights is worth it.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465800,Because it simply has so many benefits.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465801,"From the obvious, like getting stronger, to the surprising, like enhancing your brain power.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465802,So there you are.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465803,Lift some weights and you could get some big benefits.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465804,"Stronger muscles and bones, a healthy heart and immune system, and it could even help you live longer.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465805,"Right, enough.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465806,So that's it.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465807,It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465808,Which really could benefit your body and life.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465809,"If you want to hear more of the series, why not subscribe on BBC Sounds.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465810,"On the next episode of Just One Thing, go nuts.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465811,"How nibbling some nuts can give your brain a boost, reduce your waistline, and may even slow down your body's ageing process.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465812,"Hi there, I'm just popping up to let you know about another Radio 4 podcast that you may be interested in.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465813,"Especially if, like me, your social media feeds are constantly bombarding you with adverts that are hyping up the latest wonder products, promising you the world.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
