Nonetheless, their paper makes a persuasive case that UFOs certainly exist, even if they are not necessarily ETs. What appears to be happening is that official organs of the state are now acknowledging that UFOs exist, even if they are not literally using the term. They are doing so because enough pilots are reporting UFOs and near-air collisions so as to warrant better record-keeping. They are not saying that these UFOs are extraterrestrials, but they are trying to destigmatize the reporting of a UFO. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we\u2019d expect.\u201d....

Obtaining good estimates of the number of possible extraterrestrial civilizations has however been very challenging. A new study led by the University of Nottingham and published today in The Astrophysical Journal has taken a new approach to this problem. Using the assumption that intelligent life forms on other planets in a similar way as it does on Earth, researchers have obtained an estimate for the number of intelligent communicating civilizations within our own galaxy -- the Milky Way. Using the assumption that intelligent life forms on other planets in a similar way as it does on Earth, researchers have obtained an estimate for the number of intelligent communicating civilizations within our own galaxy -- the Milky Way. They calculate that there could be over 30 active communicating intelligent civilizations in our home Galaxy. Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Nottingham, Christopher Conselice who led the research, explains: \"There should be at least a few dozen active civilizations in our Galaxy under the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent life to form on other planets, as on Earth.\" Conselice also explains that, \"The idea is looking at evolution, but on a cosmic scale. We call this calculation the Astrobiological Copernican Limit.\" First author Tom Westby explains: \"The classic method for estimating the number of intelligent civilizations relies on making guesses of values relating to life, whereby opinions about such matters vary quite substantially.",

But how would they know we\u2019re here in the first place? Humanity has been leaking (or deliberately transmitting) radio waves out into space for roughly a century, To my mind, then, the enormous amounts of time and energy that are likely to be necessary for traveling between the stars in a galaxy, and the fact that raw materials can be sought elsewhere more practically, would rule out aliens coming to the Earth simply to take something we have. I think we can safely rest assured that even if intelligent alien species do exist in our galaxy, they are not about to appear in our skies with an invasion fleet to subjugate humanity and begin stripping our world. Perhaps the thing that may attract only extraterrestrials to Earth is us. I suspect that if aliens did come to Earth, it would be as researchers: biologists, anthropologists, linguists, keen to understand the peculiar workings of life on Earth, to meet humanity and learn of our art, music, culture, languages, philosophies and religions. But let\u2019s say, just for the sake of argument, that there are one or more star-faring alien civilizations in the Milky Way. We\u2019re all familiar with Hollywood\u2019s darker depictions of what aliens might do when they come to the Earth: zapping the White House, harvesting humanity for food like a herd of cattle, or sucking our oceans dry. These scenarios make great films, but don\u2019t really stand up to rational scrutiny. So let\u2019s run through a thought experiment on what reasons aliens might possibly have to visit the Earth, not because I reckon we need to ready our defenses or assemble a welcoming party, but because I think considering these possibilities is a great way of exploring many of the core themes of the science of astrobiology.",

UFOs became a major subject of interest following the development of rocketry after World War II and were thought by some researchers to be intelligent extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. Arnold estimated the speed of the crescent-shaped objects as several thousand miles per hour and said they moved \u201clike saucers skipping on water.\u201d In the newspaper report that followed, it was mistakenly stated that the objects were saucer-shaped, hence the term flying saucer. Sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena increased, and in 1948 the U.S. Air Force began an investigation of these reports called Project Sign. The initial opinion of those involved with the project was that the UFOs were most likely sophisticated Soviet aircraft, although some researchers suggested that they might be spacecraft from other worlds, the so-called extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). From 1952 to 1969 Project Blue Book compiled reports of more than 12,000 sightings or events, each of which was ultimately classified as (1) \u201cidentified\u201d with a known astronomical, atmospheric, or artificial (human-caused) phenomenon or (2) \u201cunidentified.\u201d The latter category, approximately 6 percent of the total, included cases for which there was insufficient information to make an identification with a known phenomenon. ... An American obsession with the UFO phenomenon was under way. In the hot summer of 1952 a provocative series of radar and visual sightings occurred near National Airport in Washington, D.C.
