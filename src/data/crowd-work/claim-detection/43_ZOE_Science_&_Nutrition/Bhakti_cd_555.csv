2462733,"Hello, and welcome to Zoe Shorts, the bite-sized podcast where we discuss one topic around science and nutrition.",FALSE,
2462734,"I'm Jonathan Wolfe, and today I'm joined by Dr. Sarah Berry.",FALSE,
2462735,And today's subject is nuts.,FALSE,
2462736,"And Jonathan, today's subject is a subject Jonathan absolutely love.",FALSE,
2462737,Jonathan've done loads of interventional human studies measuring the effects of eating nuts on people's health.,FALSE,
2462738,"Well, the good news is we had lots of listeners worried that nuts are full of fat and therefore are bad for you.",FALSE,
2462739,"Well, Jonathan hope that lots of listeners worried that nuts are full of fat and therefore are bad for you'll be very surprised by what we're about to discuss then.",FALSE,
2462740,.,FALSE,
2462741,Let's go nuts.,FALSE,
2462742,Sorry about that.,FALSE,
2462743,"Right, so it's important before we get into the nutritional value of nuts to point out that there's lots of different ways of consuming nuts.",FALSE,
2462744,"But on average, our consumption of nuts and seeds in the UK is about six grams per day, which doesn't sound like lots, but that's because we have a lot of people don't consume nuts at all.",FALSE,
2462745,And that also includes nut butters.,FALSE,
2462746,"To put that in perspective, one portion of nuts is around 30 grams, and one portion of nuts's roughly a small handful of nuts.",FALSE,
2462747,"So six grams is literally just a couple of nuts a day then, Dr. Sarah Berry?",FALSE,
2462748,"Yeah, that's right, Jonathan.",FALSE,
2462749,Which is a shame because Jonathan know nuts're packed full of nutrients.,FALSE,
2462750,"In fact, Jonathan've heard Tim describe the nut as a tree egg.",FALSE,
2462751,"And Dr. Sarah Berry, Dr. Sarah Berry know how much Dr. Sarah Berry like the nutrients in eggs?",FALSE,
2462752,"Yeah, absolutely.",FALSE,
2462753,And mixed nuts contain so many great nutrients.,TRUE,Medium
2462754,"mixed nuts contain fibre, mixed nuts contain vitamin E, magnesium, selenium.",TRUE,High
2462755,"And nuts are also very high in fat, but nuts're particularly high in monounsaturated fats, which we know are the healthy type of fats.",TRUE,High
2462756,"So Dr. Sarah Berry, let's get into the nuts and bolts of things, shall we?",FALSE,
2462757,Oh my gosh.,FALSE,
2462758,Dr. Sarah Berry've got loads more of these today.,FALSE,
2462759,It's a great one.,FALSE,
2462760,How do nuts affect our health then?,FALSE,
2462761,"In particular, Dr. Sarah Berry've read that nuts might be good for our hearts.",FALSE,
2462762,"Yeah, nuts do lots of great things that help our heart health.",FALSE,
2462763,"So in particular, nuts can decrease our bad LDL cholesterol, and they can also decrease our blood triglyceride concentrations.",TRUE,High
2462764,And this means that nuts might help to lower the risk of both heart disease and stroke.,TRUE,High
2462765,"Now, in addition, nuts also contain bioactives.",TRUE,High
2462766,And bioactives are tiny molecules that have lots of really special roles to play in the body.,FALSE,
2462767,"For example, some have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",FALSE,
2462768,And a great example is polyphenols.,FALSE,
2462769,And polyphenols are thought to protect your cells from damage that are caused by free radicals.,TRUE,Low
2462770,"And polyphenol chemicals from nuts can help to reduce bad cholesterol from being oxidised, which happens when LDL cholesterol reacts with free radicals.",TRUE,Low
2462771,This is great because we know that oxidised LDL cholesterol can build up in the walls of your arteries.,TRUE,Low
2462772,"oxidised LDL cholesterol can cause your arteries to become thicker and to stiffen, reducing just how much blood can actually get through your arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis, which is the first step towards heart disease and strokes.",TRUE,Low
2462773,And there's lots of different studies that have measured this.,FALSE,
2462774,And there's a number of different ones that have found that people who eat various types of nuts see a drop in the levels of oxidised LDL cholesterol by up to about 30%.,TRUE,High
2462775,"Now, on top of that, there's also impact on inflammation, isn't there?",FALSE,
2462776,And inflammation is something that we're very interested in at ZOE because of the way that inflammation seems to be linked to sort of almost every long-term disease that scientists are investigating.,FALSE,
2462777,inflammation just comes up over and over again on these podcasts and elsewhere.,FALSE,
2462778,"Now, Jonathan's understanding, looking at some of the research there is that there are also studies where people whose diets were supplemented with nuts saw a real decrease in inflammation, what they call inflammatory markers in studies where people whose diets were supplemented with nuts saw a real decrease in inflammation, what they call inflammatory markers in those papers.",TRUE,Medium
2462779,"Yeah, that's right, Jonathan.",FALSE,
2462780,"We see with lots of different types of nuts like walnuts, almonds, pistachios, if you eat over a long period of time, a portion of lots of different types of nuts like walnuts, almonds, pistachios a day, you have a reduction in many of these different types of inflammatory measures.",TRUE,High
2462781,We also know that there's an impact of eating nuts for people that have metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.,FALSE,
2462782,We know that nuts improve insulin sensitivity.,TRUE,High
2462783,We know that nuts reduce your fasting blood glucose.,TRUE,High
2462784,"But interestingly, nuts also improve your blood vessel function.",TRUE,High
2462785,And this is something Jonathan've looked at in Jonathan's own research.,FALSE,
2462786,And I think it's important to say at this point that I have received a lot of funding from the Ulmer Board of California to research the impact of almonds on cardiovascular health.,FALSE,
2462787,So Jonathan do always like to put any conflict of interest out there.,FALSE,
2462788,And we ran a study where we supplemented people with nuts for six weeks compared to a control.,FALSE,
2462789,And we found an improvement in the functioning of people's's blood vessels when people's had almonds.,FALSE,
2462790,So almost like how elastic people's blood vessels are.,FALSE,
2462791,"And finally, there's some evidence as well just emerging that nuts might even prevent memory loss as we age, although this is still at quite early stages of research.",FALSE,
2462792,So that's all pretty amazing.,FALSE,
2462793,These like tiny nuts are definitely punching well above These like tiny nuts's weight.,FALSE,
2462794,"Oh, how many more of these jokes are we going to have, Jonathan?",FALSE,
2462795,"Okay, Jonathan, we haven't even mentioned the fiber that's in nuts, which is another great property of nuts.",FALSE,
2462796,"And the fiber that's in nuts, which is another great property of nuts, simply put, is the nut cell walls.",FALSE,
2462797,"And in one 30 gram portion of peanuts, there's about two and a half grams of fiber.",TRUE,High
2462798,"And about two and a half grams of fiber is in comparison to a pack of salted crisps or potato chips, which has less than one grams of fiber.",FALSE,
2462799,And there's really compelling evidence linking high fiber intake to reducing the risk of many chronic diseases.,TRUE,Medium
2462800,"And even death, which Sarah'm particularly keen on.",FALSE,
2462801,"So as you increase your dosage of fiber, actually your life expectancy increases.",TRUE,Medium
2462802,"And this is rare, right?",FALSE,
2462803,"There's very few things actually where you see really clear impact, not just on some sort of disease, but actually whether or not you're going to live longer.",FALSE,
2462804,Yeah.,FALSE,
2462805,And fiber is the one nutrient that every nutritional scientist in the world agrees we need to be getting more of.,FALSE,
2462806,"In the UK, in the US, we consume less than 20 grams.",FALSE,
2462807,We should be getting at least 30 grams a day of fiber.,FALSE,
2462808,So what's great is These like tiny nuts are packed full of fiber.,FALSE,
2462809,And fiber basically works to feed your healthy gut bacteria.,TRUE,Low
2462810,Jonathan want to take a moment to thank you for listening to this show.,FALSE,
2462811,Our mission at ZOE is to improve the health of millions by empowering our community with the most accurate information about our own bodies based on the latest science.,FALSE,
2462812,"We think the best way to achieve this is with ZOE's personalized nutrition program, but we know some people aren't ready for ZOE's personalized nutrition program yet.",FALSE,
2462813,"And that for others, ZOE's personalized nutrition program is still too expensive.",FALSE,
2462814,And that's why we put this show out for free without ads to share the latest science with everyone.,FALSE,
2462815,"To justify us continuing this labor of love, I have a small favor to ask.",FALSE,
2462816,a small favor to ask has two parts.,FALSE,
2462817,"Firstly, if you know someone who would benefit from listening to today's podcast, please share a link to this show right now.",FALSE,
2462818,It's the continued growth in new listeners that makes us feel all the effort recording this show is worthwhile.,FALSE,
2462819,"Secondly, in whichever podcast app you're using right now, hit subscribe.",FALSE,
2462820,That's it.,FALSE,
2462821,That will mean many others are more likely to discover this show and hopefully learn something that will help many others's health.,FALSE,
2462822,Thank you so much for listening and for being a valued member of the ZOE community.,FALSE,
2462823,Enjoy the rest of this show.,FALSE,
2462824,"So Sarah, it seems pretty clear nuts have lots of benefits.",FALSE,
2462825,"nuts're also surprisingly well studied in terms of sort of the research that Jonathan're talking about compared to a lot of the topics where we say, you know, there's like three studies in the whole world ever.",FALSE,
2462826,And it seems like particularly clear to do with cardiovascular health.,FALSE,
2462827,"So, you know, sort of heart disease and Stroh's.",FALSE,
2462828,Jonathan think the elephant in the room is really weight.,FALSE,
2462829,"If nuts are high in calories, won't nuts contribute to weight gain?",FALSE,
2462830,So this is where Jonathan think it gets really interesting.,FALSE,
2462831,"And obviously Sarah'm biased because this has been the focus of Sarah's research with nuts, which is nuts's food matrix.",FALSE,
2462832,So what makes the humble nut even more special is nuts's structure.,FALSE,
2462833,And this is what Sarah call their food matrix.,FALSE,
2462834,"So Sarah, most people only know their food matrix is like a hit film 30 years ago.",FALSE,
2462835,So could Sarah explain a bit more what their food matrix is?,FALSE,
2462836,Yeah.,FALSE,
2462837,"So we're not talking about Keanu Reeves here, Jonathan.",FALSE,
2462838,"We're talking about the food structure and really simply put, the matrix just refers to the structure of a food.",FALSE,
2462839,So Sarah think a really good way to illustrate this is using almonds.,FALSE,
2462840,And let's say you had a packet of whole almonds and a packet of ground almonds.,FALSE,
2462841,"According to the back-of-pack labelling information, a packet of whole almonds and a packet of ground almonds're nutritionally identical, but actually how a packet of whole almonds and a packet of ground almonds behave in our body is really different.",FALSE,
2462842,"Nuts consist of millions of tiny cells and millions of tiny cells have cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre.",TRUE,Low
2462843,"And cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre have a really important structural role.",FALSE,
2462844,"And within cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre are tiny fat globules.",FALSE,
2462845,"Now, if Sarah very, very finely grind the nuts, Sarah break down cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre and the fat bursts out.",FALSE,
2462846,"But when you eat whole nuts, the matrix, so the structure of cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre remains intact.",FALSE,
2462847,"So the fat is remaining within cell walls, which we've already mentioned is the fibre and the fat's therefore not easily digestible.",FALSE,
2462848,And so research has shown that about 30% fewer calories are absorbed from these whole nuts compared to what's predicted based on the ingredients listed on the back-of-pack labelling.,TRUE,High
2462849,"And Jonathan, from the studies that Sarah've done where we collect poo after people have eaten whole nuts, you actually see these whole big nut particles.",FALSE,
2462850,"And if you slice through these whole big nut particles, which fortunately Sarah's researchers do rather than Sarah do, and then put these whole big nut particles under a microscope, you can actually see these hundreds of intact cells still within these chewed nut particles that we've collected from poo.",FALSE,
2462851,"And you can see within these hundreds of intact cells still within these chewed nut particles that we've collected from the poo all of these fat globules, which is why it has 30% less calories that are being absorbed.",FALSE,
2462852,"And Sarah, is this true of any plant that we eat?",FALSE,
2462853,Or is this because like most plants we cook for ages first?,FALSE,
2462854,Or is there something special and magical about nuts?,FALSE,
2462855,How do we understand that?,FALSE,
2462856,This is true of nearly all nuts.,FALSE,
2462857,So we've looked at this with lots of different types of nuts and we find consistently that the back-of-pack labelling information would overestimate the calorie amount by about 30%.,TRUE,Medium
2462858,The impact of the cell wall structure within other plants varies depending on the plant.,FALSE,
2462859,"So for example, in more carbohydrate-rich foods such as oats, you will still get full absorption of all of the nutrients.",FALSE,
2462860,"So you will still absorb all of the calories, but you will change the rate at which you absorb all of the calories.",FALSE,
2462861,"So you will lower your blood sugar response, which is beneficial if you're having really large oats versus having really finely ground oats.",FALSE,
2462862,Got it.,FALSE,
2462863,"And so if Sarah'm eating, Sarah don't know, lentils, for example, which are quite a high fibre food, Sarah know, but lentils, for example, which are quite a high fibre food do have lots of carbohydrate.",FALSE,
2462864,It's not the same as nuts.,FALSE,
2462865,"Sarah am probably going to end up extracting all of that, but it's just going to take a while.",FALSE,
2462866,"But Sarah'm going to get to it, including Sarah's bacteria, my bacteria're going to get my bacteria's way through.",FALSE,
2462867,"Whereas these nuts, it's sort of really unusual.",FALSE,
2462868,"Basically, we're sort of struggling to get all the calories out before actually all the calories's coming out the other end.",FALSE,
2462869,"Yeah, absolutely.",FALSE,
2462870,"And we've done what we call mastication studies, Jonathan, where mastication studies are even more glamorous than the poo studies that we do.",FALSE,
2462871,"mastication studies involve people chewing nuts, and at the point at which people're about to swallow, people spit nuts out.",FALSE,
2462872,We collect them and we analyse them.,FALSE,
2462873,We analyse people for how much fat is released at the point at which they're about to swallow.,FALSE,
2462874,"And what's interesting is at the point at you're about to swallow an almond, the amount of fat that's released from the chewing action bursting the cells is only about 10% at the point at you're about to swallow an almond.",FALSE,
2462875,"And this is because the cells of almonds, and it's the same with other nuts, are so, so tiny.",FALSE,
2462876,"the cells're 35 micrometres, which is tiny, yet the point at which you swallow nuts is normally around nearly one millimetre particle size.",FALSE,
2462877,And so that's why so much is entering your stomach and your intestine intact.,FALSE,
2462878,"And so that explains why actually, you know, the amount of calories you actually consume might be much less than sort of on the packet.",FALSE,
2462879,"Presumably, that does mean the more that you process nuts, the more that the fat will be released, and the more energy you'll be able to absorb.",TRUE,Low
2462880,"Yeah, and this is another really interesting area of research is looking at the effect of consuming whole nuts versus nut butters and really finely ground nut powders.",FALSE,
2462881,"And what we know is if you commercially grind the nuts to break all of the cell walls and release all of the fat, then a lot more of all of the fat is accessible and therefore you do absorb a large proportion of the calories.",TRUE,Low
2462882,"However, using the kind of techniques that you might use at home to grind nuts or to make your own nut butters, you're unlikely to be able to grind the nut to an extent that you break all of the cell walls.",FALSE,
2462883,"So you're still likely to actually have a nut that has a lot lower energy density, so lower calorie amount that's absorbed compared to if the nut was fully ground.",FALSE,
2462884,"So Jonathan guess one question follows from this, you know, you might think it's a good idea that your body isn't absorbing all the fat.",FALSE,
2462885,"But on the other hand, does it mean that all these other nutrients that you were talking about, like, you know, vitamin E and whatever else are also not going to be absorbed as much?",FALSE,
2462886,"Yeah, that's right.",FALSE,
2462887,And I've actually published research showing that the vitamin E in the blood after eating whole almonds is lots lower than the vitamin E after eating industrially ground almonds where all of the cell walls are broken down.,FALSE,
2462888,"And Sarah, Jonathan remember Sarah telling Jonathan something really extraordinary that there's a study about how many calories different individuals extract from the same nuts and sort of showing this huge variation.",FALSE,
2462889,Is that right?,FALSE,
2462890,"Yeah, absolutely.",FALSE,
2462891,"So there was a study carried out a number of years ago by David Bear in the US where they fed individuals nuts over a period of time, collected individuals's poo and had a look how much energy was excreted from consuming nuts.",FALSE,
2462892,"And what this meant in real terms is that for some people, a 30 gram portion of almonds resulted in some people eating about 56 calories.",FALSE,
2462893,"And yet for other people, eating a 30 gram portion of almonds resulted in other people eating about 168 calories.",FALSE,
2462894,So that's a huge difference.,FALSE,
2462895,"And if you extract that over a week, that's a large amount.",FALSE,
2462896,"Sarah can't do the maths off the top of Sarah's head, but Sarah think that's about 750 calorie difference.",FALSE,
2462897,"So Jonathan, I think all of this taken together goes some way to explain why, despite what a lot of people fear, research has shown that nuts simply do not cause you to put on weight.",FALSE,
2462898,"And whilst the nutritional makeup of each nut vary slightly, broadly speaking, one nut is not necessarily better than another.",FALSE,
2462899,"And any type of nut, as long as any type of nut're not coated in chocolate, salt or sugar, will make a really great addition to your diet.",FALSE,
2462900,"Sarah, what's Sarah's final conclusion?",FALSE,
2462901,"So Sarah's final thoughts are that nuts are a great addition to anyone's diet, that having different types of nuts is great because whilst nearly all nuts contain fantastic combination of healthy fats and these magic polyphenols, nearly all nuts do also differ slightly in some of nearly all nuts's other attributes.",FALSE,
2462902,So having mixed nuts is great.,FALSE,
2462903,And Sarah's other top tip is to actually try substituting your normal snacks for nuts.,FALSE,
2462904,We know that about 20% of our energy intake comes from snacks.,FALSE,
2462905,"If you can change your typical snacks to nuts, you'll really see big improvements in your health.",FALSE,
2462906,Sarah think the short summary is we think nuts are great.,FALSE,
2462907,We do.,FALSE,
2462908,"We agree on this one, Jonathan.",FALSE,
2462909,As we do on so many.,FALSE,
2462910,"Well, if you'd like to discover how nuts can best fit into your life, you may want to try Zoe's Personalised Nutrition Programme to improve your health and manage your weight.",FALSE,
2462911,You can get 10% off by going to joinzoe.com slash podcast.,FALSE,
2462912,Jonathan'm Jonathan Wolfe.,FALSE,
2462913,And Sarah'm Sarah Berry.,FALSE,
