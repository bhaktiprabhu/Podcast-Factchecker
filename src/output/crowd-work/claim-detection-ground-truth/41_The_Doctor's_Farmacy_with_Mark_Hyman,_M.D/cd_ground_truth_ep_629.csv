2458635,So why is sleep so important?,False,
2458636,How does sleep dysfunction lead to changes?,False,

2458643,"So when we're constantly in a state of stress, we're actually often struggling with sleep because of the way in which a state of stress affects our sleep.",False,Medium
2458644,"So when you think about it, when your cortisol is high, you're running from a tiger, you're in danger.",False,
2458645,You don't want to be sleeping.,False,
2458646,You want to be alert and that's the problem.,False,
2458647,"So if your cortisol levels are balanced and your cortisol levels're high in the morning and then low at night and your blood sugar stays even, we'll talk about why that's important because fluctuations in blood sugar often will cause midnight or middle of the night wakening.",False,
2458648,"But when your cortisol and your body stress response are balanced and your pineal gland produces something called melatonin that pulses really strong in the afternoon and the evening, which gets you ready for sleep and lets your cortisol drop off and then you can feel calm and go to sleep at night and feel sleepy.",True,High
2458649,"And if you're healthy and balanced in your circadian rhythms and your cortisol and melatonin cycles, you'll be fine.",False,

2458655,There's still high levels of cortisol.,False,
