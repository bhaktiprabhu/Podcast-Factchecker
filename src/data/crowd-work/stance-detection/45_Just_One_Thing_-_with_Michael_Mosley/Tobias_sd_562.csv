Researchers believe that in turn, this frees up cognitive resources for other mental activities, such as the ability to better utilize coping skills, which in turn, reduces stress. This means that for some people journaling about trauma can lead to less stress in general and a better capacity to use coping skills. Therapists know that writing is often essential for working through trauma, as it acts as a form of meditation and healing for the brain.

Another study examining the effect of expressive writing on 40 patients recovering from bladder papilloma resection found that for those high in alexithymia, writing reduced the length of hospital stay and number of physical and psychological symptoms, but this effect was not found for patients low in alexithymia (Solano, Donati, Pecci, Persichetti, & Colaci, 2003). Studies demonstrating that emotional expressiveness predicts better outcomes from expressive writing, or that inability to express emotions predicts worse outcomes, are consistent with the matching hypothesis, which suggests that matching a person’s naturally elected coping approach with contextual parameters (e.g., assigned intervention) is particularly beneficial (Engebretson, Matthews, & Scheier, 1989; Stanton et al., 2000). Although a number of studies have demonstrated that emotional expressiveness moderates the effect of expressive writing, the current body of work does not yet provide a consistent portrait of the direction of this relationship.

"And if you're under stress, you're not able to take in other information.","It seems that stress could be considered a positive component when it is under control and a negative factor when the circumstances are clearly adverse (no possibility of control) [1]. Otherwise said, when stress is moderate, it can enhance learning and memory. However, when stress becomes excessive or chronic, it can have negative effects on learning. High levels of stress can impair cognitive function, attention, and memory retrieval, leading to difficulties in concentrating, processing information, and retaining new knowledge. It is well known to most students that the stress undergone when facing an evaluation test can make it difficult to recall information that might be available in less stressful circumstances [37]. Nevertheless, the impact of stress on the process of encoding information into memory is controversial. Some authors defend that stress impairs memory functions [38]; meanwhile, others show that stress enhances memory encoding [39]. However, it is difficult to determine the factors that are responsible for the reported discrepancies. According to the information presented in this review, the impact of stress on the learning process seems to be controversial, impairing or enhancing memory functions [38,39]. The proposed explanation for this discrepancy is that stress could be considered a positive component when it is under control and a negative aspect when control is not possible [1]. Regarding emotions, they present a similar perspective. Emotions related to positive feelings (awareness, understanding, acceptance) favor the learning process; meanwhile, those related to negative feelings (distress, anxiety, threat) impair the learning process [8].

"And with expressive writing, people heal more quickly than if people're writing about superficial topics.","Encourage clients to write it down.Part of the magic of Pennebaker’s approach is that participants wrote to and for themselves. They never received feedback on their writing. The most significant benefits were often experienced by those who wrote about previously undisclosed events.Clients may eventually be willing to talk about deeply personal experiences, but Pennebaker notes some individuals get to the heart of their issues more quickly without an audience. The option to keep their writing private can help ease challenges of building trust.To try this approach, invite clients to write about a topic they have been avoiding – or any subject that strongly influences their thoughts and feelings. Although many people in Pennebaker’s studies reported feeling sad after writing about difficult experiences, this effect was short-lived and overshadowed by the benefits that followed.If clients would like to share what they wrote about, encourage them to talk about it rather than read aloud. Remind them that expressive writing is for their benefit alone. The purpose is to be completely honest with themselves. Some people choose to keep their writing and see how they change over time. Others prefer to destroy it immediately. Encourage clients to choose what works for them.It’s important to note that writing may not always be a good fit. According to Pennebaker’s research, the best time for people to write about emotional upheaval is when they believe they are thinking about it too much. It is usually not beneficial to push people to write about traumatic experiences immediately afterward. It may also be unhelpful to encourage clients to reawaken past experiences if they have already adapted well.Have them write in the waiting room.In a therapy session, the first 10 minutes are often needed for clients to catch up and re-establish the relationship. To jump-start appointments, Pennebaker recommends having clients write about their most pressing issues for 10 minutes before their appointments. With this approach, some people are much more focused and ready when sessions begin.As noted above, clients should be free to keep their writing samples. It is the writing process that is helpful – not the expectation that they read or share what they write.Suggest clients make a habit of writing in a journal.If a client finds that writing works well for them, they may want to include journaling in their daily routine. This can allow people to make the most of ongoing benefits, including stress relief, improved memory and a boost to the immune system.In the first expressive writing studies, participants experienced meaningful results after writing for 15 minutes each day. However, James Pennebaker notes there are a thousand ways to write and experience health benefits.If writing on paper doesn’t work for a client, let them know personal voice recordings can be equally effective. Encourage them to experiment and find their ideal practice.Lead clients to shift perspective once in a while.Some people can get stuck telling the same story forever, Pennebaker notes. He explains these individuals repeat the same language indefinitely and miss the potential benefits of expressive writing.If your client is stuck in a loop, try prompting them to change perspective through writing. How do they think their situation appears to another person? How would they view this situation during a time in their past or future? What insights have they uncovered as time passes?It’s important that writing doesn’t turn into another form of rumination, Pennebaker explains. If writing doesn’t seem helpful to your client, it’s best to change things up.Bring evidence-based expressive writing tools to your practice.If your clients would benefit from structure and guidance in their writing, you may want to consider an evidence-based curriculum.

And what's particularly intriguing is several studies looking at this're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,"Research on the use of ultrasound specifically in tendon healing is minimal and relates only to animals, with conflicting findings. Increases in tensile strength, energy absorption, mobility, improved collagen fibril alignment, reduction in inflammatory infiltrate and scar tissue in tendons has been demonstrated in some studies [43, 44] but not others [45–46]. These studies varied significantly with respect to the regimes used. Clinical studies of ultrasound in soft tissue injuries are limited by appropriate outcome measures (pain, swelling and function) and do not have the advantage of wound‐healing studies, which can evaluate the lesion more closely by wound tracing. Gam and Johanssen reviewed 293 papers published between 1953 and 1993 to evaluate the evidence of effect of ultrasound in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain [17]. Twenty‐two trials were found which compared ultrasound treatment with sham ultrasound, non‐ultrasound treatment or no treatment. Ultrasound is commonly used in the treatment of most soft tissue complaints, particularly lesions of tendon, ligament and bursa. Clinical studies of ultrasound in soft tissue injuries are limited by appropriate outcome measures (pain, swelling and function) and do not have the advantage of wound‐healing studies, which can evaluate the lesion more closely by wound tracing.",https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/40/12/1331/1787872,TRUE,#CHOOSE#
And what's particularly intriguing is several studies looking at this're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,"High-frequency ultrasound may provide a less-invasive means to evaluate dermal anatomy and pathology. Studies by Kuhn and Angehrn (2009) have supported the use of HFUS for quantitative skin assessment. They demonstrated the utility of using HFUS to obtain noninvasive, objective, quantitative measurements of wound healing instead of relying only on visual inspection in 22 patients with leg ulcers.

Preoperative measurement of thickness of cutaneous melanoma using high-resolution 20 MHz ultrasound imaging: A monocenter prospective study and systematic review of the literature. A comparison of HFUS assessment of skin and wound tissue with histology was performed by Rippon, Springett, Walmsley, Patrick, and Millson (1998), who visualized structures of skin (human cadaver and porcine) and healing wounds (porcine) using 20 MHz HFUS and compared them with histology from the same site. They found excellent correlation between ultrasound measurements and histology for porcine and human cadaver measurements as well as acute porcine wounds. The study demonstrated that HFUS and histology were comparable in identifying wound depth, eschar/blood clot depth, collagen accumulation, and granulation tissue depth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027962/,TRUE,#CHOOSE#
And what's particularly intriguing is several studies looking at this're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,"Studies about using ultrasound to help speed healing are not so positive. There are many studies that compare ultrasound use to sham (fake) ultrasound. These studies indicate that people who receive an ultrasound for an injury do not have a speedier, healthier recovery or a better outcome. These studies indicate that people who receive an ultrasound for an injury do not have a speedier, healthier recovery or a better outcome. For example, in a study on the use of ultrasound for knee arthritis, some of the study participants received the ultrasound treatment, while other study participants received sham ultrasound. There were no differences in the recovery of patients in either group. Other studies have had mixed results. A 2020 review of studies into the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound for chronic pain found that therapeutic ultrasound was better at relieving knee pain than other methods. Since many studies show that ultrasound offers very little to help speed healing in your injured body part, some physical therapists feel that ultrasound can “hurt” by making you feel like you need it to get better.",https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-ultrasound-really-work-2696629,TRUE,#CHOOSE#

Findings from the study revealed that ultrasound was beneficial in wound healing and stated that physical therapists can utilize high-dose ultrasound for about a week to enhance collagen deposition and wound strength[6]. Low-dose ultrasound was suggested for treatment for two weeks or more[6]. Ultrasound therapy was administered 3 times per week for 5 minutes, each treatment. Results showed an increase in the rate of healing when coupled with standard wound care.[5] McKenzie, Wong, West and Hunt conducted a single-blinded, posttest experimental study to compare the differences in wound breaking strength and collagen deposition in pigs[6]. The researchers surgically induces incisions in 48 pigs and for 5 to 10 days ultrasound was applied with either high –dose or low-dose ultrasound.",https://www.physio-pedia.com/Ultrasound_in_Wound_Healing,TRUE,#CHOOSE#
