### Supported Claims

1. And do bear in mind the human brain is about 60% fat.
2. Based on this definition, chestnuts and hazelnuts are true nuts, while almonds and cashews are classified as droops.
3. Eating nuts has even been linked to a longer life.
4. Eventually, the telomeres get too short to do the telomeres's job and our cells can't function properly.
5. If we look at the body of research out there, the body of evidence, they the body of research out there, the body of evidence seem to suggest consistently that including nuts into the diet doesn't really have much effect on your body weight.
6. In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.
7. New research shows that eating nuts can actually give your thinking skills a boost.
8. Now, one of the ideas that has been around for a long time is that eating nuts is likely to help you put on weight because nuts're so full of fat and protein, and yet Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia's research suggests that's not the case.
9. Nuts often get a bad press because Nuts are high in fat, and Nuts can cause life-threatening allergies, which is why Nuts are rightly banned from places like schools and nurseries.
10. So many, many studies have repeatedly shown that incorporating nuts into the diet doesn't make you gain weight.
11. So they are all high in protein, they are all high in unsaturated fats, which are healthy.
12. The nutty thing, botanically speaking, is that most of the nuts we like to eat aren't actually nuts, which are defined as a dry fruit with a single seed encased in a hard shell.
13. The second reason is that when we eat nuts, we feel fuller and consequently we adjust our diet in the next meal.
14. We don't absorb all the fat or all the energy from nuts when we consume nuts.
15. When we eat nuts, we get lots of fibre and, importantly, compounds called polyphenols, which feed our gut bacteria and can reduce inflammation.
16. Whether almonds and cashews are true nuts or droops, almonds and cashews are still packed full of good things like unsaturated fats, fibre and protein, as well as a number of compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are good for you.
17. nuts are good for our cognitive function.
18. nuts give you lots of good fats and we'll discuss some surprising new research on how nuts can trim your waistline and even boost your brainpower.
19. our telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes.

### Refuted Claims

1. For example, if we are talking about cardiovascular health, we see the benefits coming from almonds, we see the benefits coming from peanuts, we see the benefits coming from walnuts and other nuts as well.
2. The longer our telomeres are, the younger your DNA is, and several studies have found a link between eating nuts and retaining the length of our telomeres.
3. The one thing that Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia can say on a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day is that a lot of the beneficial compounds are found on the skin of the nuts.
4. The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.
