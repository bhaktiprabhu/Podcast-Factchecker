2465526,"We'll see if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's cracked it later this week.",False,
2465527,"The nutty thing, botanically speaking, is that most of the nuts we like to eat aren't actually nuts, which are defined as a dry fruit with a single seed encased in a hard shell.",True,Low
2465528,"Based on this definition, chestnuts and hazelnuts are true nuts, while almonds and cashews are classified as droops.",True,Low
2465529,almonds and cashews have a fleshy outer layer.,False,Low

2465531,"So good, almonds and cashews may even slow the ageing process at the cellular level by preserving our telomeres.",True,High
2465532,our telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes.,True,Low

2465547,How?,False,
2465548,"Well, we'll crack into that with an expert in a moment.",False,
2465549,"But first, let's find out how Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey is getting on.",False,
2465550,So this is day four of Mike's nut snack adventure.,False,
2465551,Mike'm really enjoying my nut snack adventure so far.,False,
2465552,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey weigh out Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's nuts in the morning.",False,
2465553,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey've been eating my nuts generally at around 11 o'clock, so as a morning snack.",False,
2465554,Emma do find my nuts quite good to munch on.,False,
2465555,Emma have been finding nuts quite satisfying.,False,
2465556,"Yeah, so midway through",False,

2465558,It sounds like Emma has found it easy to swap out Emma's sugary treats for nutty snacks.,False,
2465559,So Emma'm keen to see if Emma sticks with it.,False,
2465560,"But first, let's choose some nutty fat with an expert.",False,
2465561,Hello there.,False,
2465562,"Hi, Michael.",False,
2465563,How are Michael?,False,
2465564,"Very good, thanks.",False,
2465565,"Now, Michael can understand why nuts are good for Michael's diet, but tell Michael why nuts are good for Michael's brain.",False,
2465566,nuts are good for our cognitive function.,True,High
2465567,So this was based on a study that we published recently in 2021.,False,
2465568,We compared the nut intake and cognitive function of over 1800 older adults in America.,False,
2465569,"We found that older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day, perform significantly better in terms of older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's short-term memory, fluency, processing speed, and also attention.",True,High
2465570,"Right, and 15 to 30 grams, 15 to 30 grams was enough to produce these changes in older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's cognitive skills.",True,High
2465571,Why do an expert think that nuts are good for the brain?,False,
2465572,"In one study, they found that including nuts into the diet can actually improve the brain reactivity.",True,High
2465573,"They also found that the small blood vessels in the brain actually have higher elasticity, so meaning that there's better blood flow into the brain, potentially explaining the benefits.",True,High
2465574,And are some types of nuts better than others?,False,
2465575,"In terms of nuts, they all have very similar kind of nutrient profile.",False,
2465576,"So they are all high in protein, they are all high in unsaturated fats, which are healthy.",True,Medium
2465577,"For example, if we are talking about cardiovascular health, we see the benefits coming from almonds, we see the benefits coming from peanuts, we see the benefits coming from walnuts and other nuts as well.",True,High
2465578,So there's no reason to believe that one nut is better than another.,False,Low
2465579,"Right, that's interesting because Michael always thought that peanuts were an almost inferior type of nut.",False,
2465580,"Now, one of the ideas that has been around for a long time is that eating nuts is likely to help you put on weight because nuts're so full of fat and protein, and yet Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia's research suggests that's not the case.",True,Medium
2465581,That is correct.,False,
2465582,"If we look at the body of research out there, the body of evidence, they the body of research out there, the body of evidence seem to suggest consistently that including nuts into the diet doesn't really have much effect on your body weight.",True,Medium
2465583,"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.",True,High
2465584,"So many, many studies have repeatedly shown that incorporating nuts into the diet doesn't make you gain weight.",True,High
2465585,So why might that be?,False,
2465586,There are a number of potential explanations for that phenomenon.,False,
2465587,We don't absorb all the fat or all the energy from nuts when we consume nuts.,True,Medium
2465588,That's the first reason.,False,
2465589,"The second reason is that when we eat nuts, we feel fuller and consequently we adjust our diet in the next meal.",True,Medium
2465590,The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,True,Medium
2465591,Nuts must be one of the tougher foods that modern humans eat.,False,
2465592,"So Michael'm assuming there's something about the structure, which means we don't actually absorb quite as much of the fat that's in the nut while at the same time getting all those benefits that come with the fibre.",False,
2465593,"So if we look at the structure of nuts under the microscope, we would see something like boxes.",False,Low
2465594,So imagine if you have thousands of shoe boxes put together and within each box you have fat inside.,False,
2465595,"So in order to access the fat in thousands of shoe boxes put together, we would have to go in and break thousands of shoe boxes put together.",False,
2465596,"When we chew the nuts, we break thousands of shoe boxes put together, we release the fat in those shoe boxes.",False,
2465597,"But in the process, not all boxes are being broken.",False,
2465598,"Hence, there's still about 20% of fat left in thousands of shoe boxes put together that are not accessible by the body.",False,
2465599,Right.,False,
2465600,"Now, Michael have been using nuts as a snack.",False,
2465601,"Rather than reach for a chocolate bar, Michael tend to eat a small handful of nuts.",False,
2465602,"Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia have tried to go for sort of unsalted, healthy nuts, if you like.",False,
2465603,"Michael have to say, Michael found salted nuts more addictive.",False,
2465604,"So probably the challenge with nuts is stopping, isn't the challenge with nuts?",False,
2465605,"Small handful, fine.",False,
2465606,"Large bowlful, not fine.",False,
2465607,That's correct.,False,
2465608,"So even though we do see a lot of benefits coming from nuts, we don't recommend people to go nuts about eating nuts.",False,
2465609,We do want people to maintain at a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day.,False,
2465610,The one thing that Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia can say on a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day is that a lot of the beneficial compounds are found on the skin of the nuts.,True,Low
2465611,"So when you prepare your nuts, whether it's in cooking or in baking or consuming your nuts on its own, make sure that you consume the skin of the nuts together with the nuts in order to get all the nutrients, all the beneficial compounds coming from nuts.",False,Low
2465612,So that's the science.,False,
2465613,Now let's check in one more time with Emma to see if Emma's enjoyed Emma's nutty week.,False,
2465614,"So it's the end of Emma's nut challenge week and Emma've really enjoyed her nutty week, actually.",False,
2465615,"Emma've had them in the morning with some yogurt, which was lovely.",False,
2465616,Emma think it did help regulate Emma's mealtimes a bit better.,False,
2465617,Emma've definitely found Emma'm eating less chocolate.,False,
2465618,Emma think Emma's energy levels have improved.,False,
2465619,"Emma'm not crushing so much during the day, which is great.",False,
2465620,"So yes, Emma'm going to try and continue.",False,
2465621,I am pleased to hear that Emma has gone nuts for nuts.,False,
2465622,"And as promised, I've been doing the challenge all week too.",False,
2465623,"I have been snacking on nuts quite a bit, as well as incorporating more nuts into my meals.",False,
2465624,So today I'm making an apple hazelnut salad.,False,
2465625,"As you can hear, I've been slicing the apples and I've got a packet of hazelnuts here.",False,
2465626,I'm just going to sort of scatter a packet of hazelnuts around a bit and grab a few as well.,False,
2465627,Nibbling on nuts has really given me a boost.,False,
2465628,It's also helped Emma stay away from those mid-afternoon biscuits.,False,
2465629,I am definitely going to be sticking to a nuttier diet.,False,
2465630,So why don't you give a nuttier diet a go as well?,False,
2465631,"Your brain, heart and even your waistline might thank you for a nuttier diet.",False,
2465632,So that's it.,False,
2465633,"a nuttier diet's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",False,
2465634,"On the next episode of Just One Thing, cook with turmeric.",False,

2465637,"And we begin, where do we begin, Robin?",False,
2465638,"We start in a galaxy far, far away and a long time ago.",False,
2465639,So it's Australia.,False,
2465640,"Oh, OK.",False,
2465641,Australia then.,False,
2465642,"We start, it felt like a galaxy to me, but we were in Australia where we talked about, well, spiders.",False,
2465643,You were scared of spiders.,False,
2465644,"Robin wasn't actually scared, but you'll hear many trailers for this thing where they say, I wasn't scared of spiders.",False,
2465645,"We also did astronomy actually in Australia, which is fantastic.",False,
2465646,"And then we came back to the UK and we had guests like Ross Noble, Susan Calliman, Russell Kane, Ed Byrne, Joe Brand, Sally Gunnell.",False,
2465647,"Yeah, Anna Fry, Sue Black, Randa Munro.",False,
