And mixed nuts contain so many great nutrients.,"Nuts are a rich source of proteins and essential amino acids as indicated by the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference [10] and as presented in Table 1. The major sources of proteins are peanuts, almonds, and pistachios, while chestnuts are the poorest in proteins. Chung et al. [11] reported higher protein content for some of these nuts, which can be ascribed to different geographic regions. Nuts are rich in several nutrients, although with great differences between them and minor but sometimes still significant variations within cultivars. Lipid content and fatty acid profile are two of the parameters that can change considerably when discussing nut composition (Table 4 and Table 5). Besides these great variations between nut species, changes in lipid content and profile can also occur due to several other factors, with genotype as one of the most important that influences nut composition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10000569/,SUPPORTS

Polyphenols hypothesized to be anti-carcinogenic are thought to arrest cellular growth by inducing cell senescence or apoptotic cell death, and their differential redox status may selectively affect tumor cells (14). The mechanisms of these benefits vary based on the polyphenolic compound, but include protection of pancreatic beta cells from oxidation, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action, decreased starch digestion due to the suppression of enzyme activity, and the inhibition of advanced glycation end product formation (28).

Substitution of carbohydrates or saturated fats (SFA) with unsaturated fats may be responsible for improvements in insulin sensitivity [40,70]. This was supported by an SRMA of 102 RCTs, which showed replacing carbohydrates or SFAs with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs or PUFAs, respectively) improved markers of glycemic control, including HbA1c and HOMA-IR [70,71]. It should be noted that evidence involving the study of PUFAs tended to include a combination of these fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) along with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA); whereas, the PUFA found in nuts is ALA. Additionally, more studies in individuals with T2D are needed to demonstrate the impact of nuts on glycemic control (e.g., HbA1c, etc.). To determine a possible causal effect, conducting larger and longer RCTs (such as a multicentre RCT) evaluating markers of glycemic control as primary endpoints is needed in order to expand current knowledge to assess the effect of nuts on diabetes prevention in high-risk participants. Acutely, insulin sensitivity analysis testing the effect of nut consumption, such as replacing carbohydrates, using the Bergman Minimal Model of glucose regulation and clamps would aid in increasing the strength of available evidence.

For perspective, a 100 mg amount of magnesium is approximately equivalent to the magnesium content in about ¼ cup of nuts, depending on nut type [8,9]. When considering individuals with T2D, oral magnesium supplementation, equivalent to just over ½ cup of nuts, significantly improved glycemic control indicators, including HbA1c, IL, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B and insignificantly decreased fasting blood glucose [86].

And there's really compelling evidence linking high fiber intake to reducing the risk of many chronic diseases.,"Dietary fibre intake associates with overall metabolic health (through key pathways that include insulin sensitivity) and a variety of other pathologies that include cardiovascular disease, colonic health, gut motility and risk for colorectal carcinoma. Dietary fibre intake also correlates with mortality. The gut microflora functions as an important mediator of the beneficial effects of dietary fibre, including the regulation of appetite, metabolic processes and chronic inflammatory pathways. Conclusions: Multiple factors contribute to our fibre-impoverished modern diet. Given the plethora of scientific evidence that corroborate the multiple and varied health benefits of dietary fibre, and the risks associated with a diet that lacks fibre, the optimization of fibre within our diets represents an important public health strategy to improve both metabolic and overall health. A dose–response meta-analysis also revealed a pooled relative risk reduction by 9% for CVD mortality for an increment of 10g/day of dietary fibre intake [77]. Based on the available published literature, including meta-analyses and large population-based studies, there does appear to be an association between dietary fibre intake and both risk and mortality from CVD (including coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease). Evidence also suggests an association of dietary fibre with reduced mortality from cancer.

Evidence also suggests an association of dietary fibre with reduced mortality from cancer. As with other human-based studies on dietary fibre, there remains a question regarding causality, and other healthy lifestyle factors that associate with increased intake of dietary fibre may mediate at least some of the apparent benefits of dietary fibre on CVD risk.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7589116/,SUPPORTS
And there's really compelling evidence linking high fiber intake to reducing the risk of many chronic diseases.,"Higher dietary fibre intakes are associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and increasing intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors. The extent to which dietary fibre can further reduce risk for those with CVD and treated with cardioprotective drugs has not been clearly established. We have examined the evidence for dietary fibre as adjunct therapy in those with CVD or hypertension. Background Higher dietary fibre intakes are associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and increasing intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors.

And there's really compelling evidence linking high fiber intake to reducing the risk of many chronic diseases.,"However, evidence has shown this practice to be more of an urban legend than helping to reduce recurrences, and can deter people from eating foods that may actually help their condition in the future. Although the role of diet with diverticular disease has long been debated, a high-fiber intake with a focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables has been found to have a strong association with decreased risk of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Because of this reduced amount of available bile acids, the liver will pull cholesterol from the blood to make new bile acids, thereby lowering blood cholesterol. [3] A meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials found a modest benefit of dietary soluble fiber in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. [4] Epidemiological studies find that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and deaths from cardiovascular disease. When comparing the highest to lowest intakes of fiber, there was a 25% reduced risk of breast cancer. [32] This protection of dietary fiber on breast cancer risk was also found in a later meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies when comparing highest to lowest fiber intakes. It was found protective from both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers. [33] A high-fiber diet was also associated with a lower risk of benign breast disease, a risk factor in adolescents for the later development of breast cancer.",https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/fiber/,SUPPORTS
