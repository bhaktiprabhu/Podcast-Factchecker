2458618,"Now, let's get back to this week's episode of The Doctor's Pharmacy.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458619,Welcome to The Doctor's Pharmacy.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458620,I'm Dr. Mark Hyman.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458621,That's pharmacy with an F in place for conversations that matter.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458622,"Today, I'm bringing you a health bite to improve your health because taking small steps every day can lead to significant change over time.",1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458623,"Today, we're going to talk about sleep and not just sleep problems in general, but why we may wake up between 1 and 4 in the morning and how you can fix that because a lot of times people have restless sleep.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458624,people wake up at night.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458625,"people can't go back to sleep and it really affects the quality of people's health, people's life and everything else.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458626,"Sleep is critical to our health, to longevity, to our mental health, to basically every physiological function we have and it really is important to fix Sleep.",3,0,Checkworthy
2458627,Let's talk about what you can do to stay asleep and to sleep more deeply.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458628,"So, we know that poor sleep makes us less productive, poor sleep makes us tired, hard to focus.",3,0,Checkworthy
2458629,"Basically, having sleep deprivation is basically equivalent to being drunk.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458630,"In terms of your performance, you know, Dr. Mark read a study once where they were snipers who were, you know, excellent shots and if snipers who were, you know, excellent shots had 8 hours sleep, snipers who were, you know, excellent shots were like 100% accurate.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458631,"If snipers who were, you know, excellent shots had 7 hours sleep, snipers who were, you know, excellent shots were like 95% accurate.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458632,"If snipers who were, you know, excellent shots had 6 hours sleep, snipers who were, you know, excellent shots were like 70% accurate and if snipers who were, you know, excellent shots were like less than 6 hours sleep, snipers who were, you know, excellent shots were basically like 50%, it's like almost a hit and miss.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458633,"So, not good even when you're an expert in something, you can't function when you're tired.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458634,"So, next to sort of nutrition, exercise and maybe even before nutrition, exercise, some would argue sleep may be the fundamental foundation of health and disease prevention and even weight control.",3,0,Checkworthy
2458635,So why is sleep so important?,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458636,How does sleep dysfunction lead to changes?,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458637,"Well, there's a very important hormone called cortisol which is your stress hormone and a very important hormone called cortisol which is your stress hormone helps when a very important hormone called cortisol which is your stress hormone's imbalanced to go up in the morning to get you energetic and focused and do the things you need to do for the day and at night, a very important hormone called cortisol which is your stress hormone's supposed to go down and you're supposed to calm down and relax.",3,0,Checkworthy
2458638,"Now, a lot of people have an inversion where a lot of people's cortisol is all in the morning, a lot of people can't get out of bed and at night, a lot of people're tired and wired.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458639,Sound familiar?,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458640,Dr. Mark bet you some big experience that Dr. Mark certainly have at different moments in Dr. Mark's life.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458641,"When you lay and get down in bed, you're exhausted but you can't fall asleep because you're just wired.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458642,"It has to do with your adrenal glands and your adrenal glands're designed to keep things in balance to regulate your weight, to moderate your stress response, to control blood sugar, regulate inflammation and regulate sleep and wake cycles.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458643,"So when we're constantly in a state of stress, we're actually often struggling with sleep because of the way in which a state of stress affects our sleep.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458644,"So when you think about it, when your cortisol is high, you're running from a tiger, you're in danger.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458645,You don't want to be sleeping.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458646,You want to be alert and that's the problem.,2,0,Checkworthy
2458647,"So if your cortisol levels are balanced and your cortisol levels're high in the morning and then low at night and your blood sugar stays even, we'll talk about why that's important because fluctuations in blood sugar often will cause midnight or middle of the night wakening.",3,0,Checkworthy
2458648,"But when your cortisol and your body stress response are balanced and your pineal gland produces something called melatonin that pulses really strong in the afternoon and the evening, which gets you ready for sleep and lets your cortisol drop off and then you can feel calm and go to sleep at night and feel sleepy.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458649,"And if you're healthy and balanced in your circadian rhythms and your cortisol and melatonin cycles, you'll be fine.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458650,"But if your cortisol is high in the afternoon or high in the evening, you might feel tired and wired.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458651,"You want to sleep, but you can't.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458652,Or you might fall asleep because you're really tired,1,1,Checkworthy
2458653,"Or you might fall asleep because you're really tired and then you wake up in the middle of the night, like between one and four.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458654,"And that happens when you sort of go, go, go, go, go, do your email, you're working, working, working and busy and then you go to bed and you fall asleep because you're exhausted but you end up waking up because your body is still in a stress state.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458655,There's still high levels of cortisol.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458656,So how does stress affect your sleep-wake cycles?,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458657,"Well, stress works in a lot of different ways.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458658,"Psychological stress can be a big factor, right?",1,1,Checkworthy
2458659,"Worries about family, work, money, physical stresses, lack of exercise is a stress, believe it or not.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458660,"Too much screen time, junk food, toxic lifestyles, hormonal imbalances, environmental toxins.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458661,"Too much screen time, junk food, toxic lifestyles, hormonal imbalances, environmental toxins drive increased inflammation, increased brain inflammation, and also increased cortisol.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458662,"Because by the way, do you know this, that when you eat sugar or starch, your body responds by jerking up the adrenaline and cortisol levels.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458663,So literally eating sugar is a stressful experience to your body.,2,0,Checkworthy
2458664,"Even if you're getting pleasure and you don't think it's stressful and you're meditating while you're eating sugar, you're still going to have high cortisol and high adrenaline.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458665,So what are the things that are the two most common things that are screwing up your sleep-wake cycles?,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458666,It's probably blood sugar imbalances and spikes and crashes in blood sugar and chronic stress.,2,1,Checkworthy
2458667,So what should you do to optimize nutrition so you can regulate your stress hormones through food and lifestyle and how do you deal with actually regulating sleep throughout the whole night and get high quality sleep?,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458668,"So first thing is our bodies, whether we like it or not, are biological organisms and our bodies run in circadian rhythms and our bodies need to be balanced.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458669,So you have to live in rhythm.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458670,I experienced the dangers of not being in rhythm when I worked in the emergency room.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458671,I would sometimes work at 7 in the morning until 5 at night shift.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458672,Then I'd work at 2 in the afternoon until the 2 in the morning shift.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458673,Then I'd work at 11 o'clock at night to a 7 in the morning shift.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458674,"Then I'd work at 8 in the morning to an 8 in the morning shift, 24 hour shift.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458675,I was all over the place and my whole system became dysregulated and ultimately it led to chronic fatigue syndrome and a bunch of other stuff.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458676,My system just kind of collapsed because I was pushing through all these circadian rhythms which have to be in balance for you to be healthy.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458677,"And whether we like it or not, we tend to do a lot better from our health perspective if we go to bed at the same time, if we wake at the same time, if we eat at the same time.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458678,Our bodies are designed like that.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458679,So you want to make sure that you actually don't eat before bed because that's the worst thing you can do.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458680,But you need to make sure you're having meals in a regular time space.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458681,So don't eat three hours before bed.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458682,Don't eat a heavy meal before bed because I guarantee you that'll screw up your sleep.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458683,"Also carbohydrates, I think if you want to actually eat some starchy things like sweet potatoes or some more starchy foods and you can handle it metabolically, make sure you do it at night because the serotonin levels go up and it helps with sleep when you have your carbohydrates.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458684,"But still don't eat white flour, sugar, processed, all that processed food.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458685,Also not eating enough is stressful.,1,2,Not Checkworthy
2458686,"If your body's not getting enough food, it's also considered a stress.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458687,Now you can do time-restricted eating and you can sort of narrow the window in which you eat for longevity purposes and so on.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458688,But you also want to make sure you're getting enough food and not actually starving because that will increase cortisol and you'll wake in the middle of the night.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458689,"Now if you want to lose weight, you can use what I think is probably the most effective treatment I've ever found, which is the 10-Day Detox Diet.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458690,"the most effective treatment I've ever found, which is the 10-Day Detox Diet helped people lose 120, 130, 200 pounds.",2,1,Checkworthy
2458691,", which is the 10-Day Detox Diet's like a gastric bypass without the pain of surgery vomiting and malnutrition.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458692,Another thing you can do is get stuff out of your head.,0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458693,"Write your worries down at night, so get a little piece of paper or journal or maybe in your phone.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458694,"Write down all your worries, what you have to do, your day should be organized for the next day.",0,3,Not Checkworthy
2458695,Free up your mind so you can actually let go of things and go into a deep restful sleep.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458696,"Next, you can try a number of supplements and things that I found very helpful.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2458697,Magnesium is super important.,1,0,Checkworthy
2458698,Magnesium's the relaxation mineral.,1,0,Checkworthy
2458699,"Magnesium helps regulate the stress response, helps regulate cortisol, helps relax your muscles.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458700,"I recommend 200 to 400, even more of magnesium glycinate before bed.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2458701,"Glycine also helps with sleep, so you can use glycine and you can use glycine to help relax the nervous system and your muscles.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458702,"Next, try some melatonin.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458703,Mellow out with a little melatonin.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458704,"You can use half to up to two to three milligrams of melatonin at night and that can often help you reset your circadian rhythms, particularly with travel.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458705,Also ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb that can be really powerful for resetting cortisol.,2,0,Checkworthy
2458706,"I use a product called Cortisol Manager, which helps at night to reduce the stress response and improve sleep quality.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458707,"Also make sure, as I said, to get in rhythm, where you can sleep at the same time.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458708,Try to go to sleep before 10.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458709,"That's the best sleep you can have is before midnight, believe it or not.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458710,"So get in bed by 10, try to be asleep shortly thereafter, 11 at the latest, and try to wake up at the same time every day.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458711,Also make your bedroom completely sleep supportive.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458712,"For example, make sure you have eye shades or blackout shades on your windows or eye shades on your eyes, earplugs if it's noisy.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458713,Make sure you really take care of creating a carefully controlled environment.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458714,Next is caffeine.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458715,"You know, some of us tolerate caffeine okay and metabolize caffeine, others don't.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458716,"So I encourage you to sort of maybe stop after breakfast, coffee, don't have coffee throughout the day.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458717,That's particularly important.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458718,"If you're still struggling, I would probably just stop coffee and caffeine altogether.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2458719,Alcohol definitely screws up sleep.,2,0,Checkworthy
2458720,"So if you want to sleep well and you're not sleeping well, quit alcohol.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458721,Just get off alcohol.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458722,alcohol can interrupt sleep.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458723,alcohol creates poor sleep quality.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458724,Also sunlight is a basic great medicine.,2,0,Checkworthy
2458725,You know what I mean?,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458726,"Sunlight, I'm going to go to sleep.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2458727,"No, but 20 minutes of sunlight in the morning without sunglasses on, outdoors, not behind a window has a big effect on your circadian rhythm.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458728,So we are a photobiomodulating organisms.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458729,"The light affects us, The light regulates our biology.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458730,And it's important to make sure you have a good 20 minutes of light exposure in the morning.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458731,So those are some simple tips that you can do to help sleep issues.,1,1,Checkworthy
2458732,"Often by the way at night, if you're having a crash and hot flashes at night and night sweats a crash and hot flashes at night and night sweats can often be low sugar.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458733,And so that's really important to balance your insulin and blood sugar.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458734,"And I've written a lot about that, like the 10 Day Detox Diet is a great way to do that.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458735,"Now, if you're still having trouble sleeping, there are many other reasons.",1,1,Checkworthy
2458736,"It could be inflammation from food sensitivities, it could be thyroid issues, could be menopausal stuff, could be toxins, heavy metals, depression, many things, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue.",2,0,Checkworthy
2458737,"Make sure you work with a functional medicine doctor, but check it out.",0,2,Not Checkworthy
2458738,And I hope that was helpful for you.,0,2,Not Checkworthy
