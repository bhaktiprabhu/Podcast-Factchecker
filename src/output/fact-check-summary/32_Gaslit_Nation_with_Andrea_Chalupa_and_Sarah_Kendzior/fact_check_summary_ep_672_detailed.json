        "A recent government report said that it can't be ruled out that these UFOs're not aliens.",
        "I mean, these UFOs had no, you know, aerodynamic surfaces, no wings, no tails, no propellers, no exhaust, no sound, no rivets.",
        "And certainly these UFOs seemed not to be anything that anyone on Earth was capable of in terms of these UFOs's speed, these UFOs's maneuverability, these UFOs's ability to disappear and appear, operate even underwater in some cases.",
        "these UFOs seem to go into the water and out of the water, not just the atmosphere.",
        "Well, if there is intelligent life, there are such a thing as aliens among us visiting Earth.",
        "There was some kind of a landing, according to 60 school kids who saw this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995.",
        "You know, 60 school kids who saw it saw this craft land and two beings as 60 school kids who saw it described it later.",
        "So there are things in the atmosphere that seem to be under intelligent control that we cannot explain that much."

While it is certainly premature to speculate as to whether these flying objects come from another world, the US military has recently confirmed the authenticity of several videos and images showing encounters with unidentified flying objects \u2013 fueling questions about what the Pentagon knows about such incidents and others like them.

Next month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies are scheduled to deliver unclassified reports on UFOs to Congress.

He says he resigned from the Defense Department in 2017 in protest over the secrecy surrounding the program and the internal opposition to funding it. But in reality, interest in the Pentagon\u2019s handling of reported unidentified flying objects has more to do with ensuring any potential national security implications are being taken seriously \u2013 whether they are of this world or not.",

Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed to CNN that images and footage of a blinking triangular object in the sky, along with other UAPs that were categorized as a \u201csphere\u201d, \u201cacorn\u201d and \u201cmetallic blimp\u201d, were taken by navy personnel in 2019.

Last April, the Pentagon released three videos of UAPs taken in 2004 and 2015 that included audio of pilots amazed at the speed of the objects they were seeing. \u201cLook at that thing, dude!\u201d one pilot said.",

The new Pentagon report doesn\u2019t compel us to accept the reality of alien visitation. But it does compel us to take UFOs seriously. The Pentagon\u2019s UAP task force represents an abrupt reversal of this longstanding organisational policy. UFO reports, made primarily by military personnel, are no longer pollutants. They are now important data with national security implications. UFO reports, made primarily by military personnel, are no longer pollutants. They are now important data with national security implications. That said, they do still represent \u201cuncomfortable knowledge\u201d. As the late Oxford University anthropologist Steve Rayner observed, knowledge can be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for institutions in two ways. First, Rayner said, \u201cacknowledging potential information by admitting it to the realm of what is \u2018known\u2019 may undermine the organisational principles of a society or organisation\u201d.",

Last year, when the Pentagon initially confirmed the leaked UAP incidents were indeed encounters with unidentified objects, the witnesses involved in the sightings went from the fringe to the mainstream. The frank admissions \u201ckind of made me and my shipmates the most well-sought-after UFO experiencers,\u201d Voorhis says. But the ripple effects of the sighting never really went away.
