Importantly, epidemiological evidence suggests that amongst those doing none, small-to-moderate increases in muscle-strengthening exercise at the population level are likely to have considerable public health benefits. Yet, current conservative population estimates suggest that between 10-30% of adults report meeting the muscle-strengthening exercise guideline, a far lower proportion than those meeting the MVPA guideline (~ 50%). Success in large-scale interventions adherence/adherence of the muscle-strengthening exercise guideline at the population level will likely be contingent upon several multi-level and concurrent approaches. This current opinion provides an overview of the emerging discipline of muscle-strengthening exercise epidemiology. First, we define muscle-strengthening exercise, and discuss its recent addition into the global physical activity guidelines, which were historically mainly focused on aerobic physical activity (walking, running, cycling etc.). Second, we provide an overview of the current clinical and epidemiological evidence on the associations between muscle-strengthening exercise and health, showing a reduced mortality risk, and beneficial cardiometabolic, musculoskeletal, functional and mental health-related outcomes.",https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-020-00271-w,False,

Moreover, attention should also be paid to evidence that most programmes providing benefits for musculoskeletal health in elderly people are performed ≥2 days/week.12 The longitudinal influence of muscle-strengthening activities on mortality and NCDs should be further investigated with a focus on the elderly population in future studies. Physical activity guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activities for adults, and this recommendation is primarily based on the benefits for musculoskeletal health. Previous meta-analyses have shown that muscle-strengthening activities are associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality and kidney cancer, although the dose–response association is unknown. Further studies are needed to update the literature and expand on previous studies that did not provide evidence on the optimal dose of muscle-strengthening activities. In addition, investigating the dose–response association is also necessary to determine the amount of muscle-strengthening activities that should be recommended for public health purposes. A recent narrative review suggested the existence of dose–response associations between muscle-strengthening activities and mortality and major NCDs.14 With the increasing number of relevant cohort studies, it is now possible to systematically update and expand on previous reviews that did not directly provide the optimal dose of muscle-strengthening activities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9209691/,False,

"An American study found that muscle mass is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more than weight or body mass index.","Furthermore, several studies found that muscle strength or function began to decline even before muscle mass decrease and was better predictors of mortality30,31,32. Such discrepancy could be due to differences in study design, population studied, and method used for body composition measurement. As to extremely old individuals, the factors that predict mortality are generally not similar to those of the younger counterparts. The present study found that muscle mass is a predictor of long-term mortality in the oldest-old population. To the best of our knowledge, though previous studies on nonagenarians and centenarians have widely investigated functional and cognitive decline, only few studies evaluated the association between muscle mass or strength and mortality. Gueresi33 showed that mid-upper arm circumference, which is a helpful indicator of muscle mass, had prognostic significance for the survival of elderly Italian individuals aged 98 years and over. Another cohort study in Italy planned to investigate the body composition of nonagenarians. However, to date, only the baseline data from the survey were reported34. In addition, Taekema reported that poor handgrip strength predicts accelerated dependency in ADL and cognitive decline in oldest old35. Thus, more prospective studies should be carried out to confirm our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focused on muscle mass as a predictor of long-term mortality in nonagenarians and centenarians. In this study, the muscle mass of the participants was 6.11 ± 0.53 kg/m2 in men and 4.00 ± 0.63 kg/m2 in women, respectively; and was associated with long-term mortality adjusted with other potential confounders for women. Previous studies have addressed the decrease in ASM or SMI with age in various populations. In Hong Kong, a cohort study showed that the rate of decline in ASM is more rapid with increasing age, with a percentage loss −1.59% and −2.02% in men and women, respectively21. Another study on the Chinese community-dwelling elderly individuals is being conducted, and the authors showed that the SMI of the population aged ≥ 75 years was 7.09 ± 0.07 kg/m2 in men and 5.67 ± 0.07 kg/m2 in women, which were significantly lower than that of the preceding age group22. However, there lacks the reliable reference data for individuals older than 90 years. The mean SMI of the population was 6.11 ± 0.53 kg/m2 in men and 4.00 ± 0.63 kg/m2 in women in present study, respectively. If low muscle mass was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) algorithm23, only 17 participants (12 men and 5 women) met the cutoff value. So we identified that the long-lived populations were still not free of the decline of muscle mass and hypothesized that the low muscle mass might increase the mortality rate. Several studies identified that low muscle mass or various surrogate markers, including arm muscle area, MAC, CC, fat-free mass, and lean mass, were associated with an increased mortality in elderly24,25,26,27,28. However, studies on the association between muscle mass and mortality in the young-old population are not consistent; for example, the Invecchiare in Chianti (InChianti) Study reported that the muscle cross-sectional area of the calf was not related to the deaths in the population with a mean age of 74.5 years29. Our data also demonstrated that the low muscle mass only increased the female mortality in the oldest-old population; in men, the impact of the low muscle mass was less lethal compared to cognitive impairment and disability.

Researchers found that those who had more muscle mass were at a lower risk of death from all causes.,"A study of 4107 UK men reported no association between fat-free mass index and mortality but greater midarm muscle circumference, an indicator of muscle mass, was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality (HR of quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56–0.88).20 Of note, fat mass index was not mutually adjusted in the models of fat-free mass index and midarm muscle circumference. Moreover, fat mass index and other obesity related measures such as WC and WHR were not significantly associated with mortality in the multivariable models. Regional adiposity (i.e., leg or trunk) and fat-free mass index were not significantly associated with total mortality. On the other hand, a recent study using the same cohort reported that muscle mass was inversely associated with mortality.18 Higher appendicular skeletal muscle index was associated with 18% decreased risk of mortality in US adults (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.73–0.92 per 1 kg/m2). A stronger inverse association was found for younger adults (HR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.48–0.83 per 1 kg/m2) compared to older adults (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99 per 1 kg/m2). Numerous studies have examined the association between body mass index and mortality and often observed that risk of mortality was higher in those with lower body mass index than those who were overweight or even obese (“obesity paradox”).

Some of the studies indicate that the relationship between strength training and insulin resistance is due to the body mass effect, which suggests that the muscle hypertrophy gained from strength training increases insulin sensitivity [13, 14]. However, other studies examining the mass effect have concluded that there is not a significant relationship between the increase in muscle mass due to strength training and insulin resistance [15, 16]. Additionally, some research indicates that differences in waist circumference have a meaningful influence on the strength training and insulin sensitivity relationship [17], whereas other research does not support the mediating role of abdominal adiposity [18]. In a six-month trial assessing both aerobic and strength training, Poehlman et al. concluded that strength training increases insulin sensitivity by increasing fat-free mass [14]. In a 16-week strength training study, results showed a decrease in insulin resistance and an increase in muscle fiber size, or hypertrophy, suggesting that the decrease in insulin resistance after 16 weeks of strength training was due to muscle hypertrophy [13]. Hypertrophy may increase the amount of skeletal muscle tissue and GLUT 4 receptors [13, 14].

Because muscle is the primary tissue contributing to whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal, we hypothesized that insulin sensitivity would increase and dysglycemia would decrease with increases in whole-body skeletal muscle mass as a fraction of total body mass. To test this hypothesis, we examined the associations of skeletal muscle mass [assessed by bioelectrical impedance (BI) measurement] with insulin resistance and dysglycemia in a nationally representative sample.

Now, Spranger et al. show that immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor may involve negative feedback loops dependent on an infiltrating immune response. The authors noticed that even tumors that are infiltrated with CD8+ T cells are not rejected and that this correlated with expression of three types of immunosuppressives: indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), PD-L1/B7-H1, and regulatory T cells. Mechanistic studies in mice suggested that CD8+ T cells were required to be in the tumor microenvironment for the up-regulation of these immunosuppressives. Extending these studies to the clinic, patients with inflammatory tumor infiltrates will thus be more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint therapies. Tumor escape from immune-mediated destruction has been associated with immunosuppressive mechanisms that inhibit T cell activation. Although evidence for an active immune response, including infiltration with CD8+ T cells, can be found in a subset of patients, those tumors are nonetheless not immunologically rejected. In the current report, we show that it is the subset of T cell–inflamed tumors that showed high expression of three defined immunosuppressive mechanisms: indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), PD-L1/B7-H1, and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting that these inhibitory pathways might serve as negative feedback mechanisms that followed, rather than preceded, CD8+ T cell infiltration. Mechanistic studies in mice revealed that up-regulated expression of IDO and PD-L1, as well as recruitment of Tregs, in the tumor microenvironment depended on the presence of CD8+ T cells. The former was driven by interferon-γ and the latter by a production of CCR4-binding chemokines along with a component of induced proliferation. Our results argue that these major immunosuppressive pathways are intrinsically driven by the immune system rather than being orchestrated by cancer cells, and imply that cancer immunotherapy approaches targeting negative regulatory immune checkpoints might be preferentially beneficial for patients with a preexisting T cell–inflamed tumor microenvironment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a88d0f62043cd63ac768026530d6f51ec3f312b6,False,
It can even enhance your immunity.,"Walk into a store, and you will find bottles of pills and herbal preparations that claim to ""support immunity"" or otherwise boost the health of your immune system. Although some preparations have been found to alter some components of immune function, thus far there is no evidence that they actually bolster immunity to the point where you are better protected against infection and disease. Demonstrating whether an herb — or any substance, for that matter — can enhance immunity is, as yet, a highly complicated matter. Scientists don't know, for example, whether an herb that seems to raise the levels of antibodies in the blood is actually doing anything beneficial for overall immunity. The idea of boosting your immunity is enticing, but the ability to do so has proved elusive for several reasons. The immune system is precisely that — a system, not a single entity. To function well, it requires balance and harmony. There is still much that researchers don't know about the intricacies and interconnectedness of the immune response. For now, there are no scientifically proven direct links between lifestyle and enhanced immune function. Many products on store shelves claim to boost or support immunity. But the concept of boosting immunity actually makes little sense scientifically. In fact, boosting the number of cells in your body — immune cells or others — is not necessarily a good thing.

And it appears that strength training can also directly impact both your brain function and brain structure.,"Recent research conducted by Ariel University has uncovered a fascinating connection between strength training and brain function. Let's explore the incredible benefits of strength training and discover how getting stronger is closely related to getting smarter. Imagine this: as you engage in challenging resistance exercises, your body responds by releasing powerful chemicals that have a profound impact on your brain. But there's more to strength training than just boosting brain function. It unlocks the potential of brain plasticity—the brain's remarkable ability to rewire and adapt. With each challenging exercise, you're stimulating the growth and survival of neurons, paving the way for enhanced cognitive flexibility. This means becoming more adept at thinking outside the box, finding creative solutions, and adapting to new situations with ease. In addition, it is relevant for recovery from brain surgery and to counteract age-related cognitive decline. Excellent news for those who already do AURUM once a week: You not only benefit from the positive effect of resistance exercise on your brain plasticity and cognitive function but also from bone and muscle strength!

"And in two studies, we found that strength training had benefits for both the cognitive function, as well as metrics acquired on neuroimaging.","In addition, we showed that the brain association map of grip strength was highly similar to that of the behavioral phenotypes and that the GMV significantly and partially mediated their associations. These findings raised the possibility that common neurobiological pathways underlie individual differences in grip strength and these behavioral outcomes [58]. Indeed, this hypothesis has gained support from neuroimaging studies linking higher grip strength and better cognitive performance to greater brain volume. For instance, a cross-sectional study in 835 older adults observed that weakness in strength was associated with reduced GMV in the hippocampus and fusiform cortex, which were implicated in high-order cognitive processing and social functioning [57]. Similarly, subcortical nuclei degeneration may underlie the pathogenesis of “cognitive frailty,” which was defined as the simultaneous presence of cognitive decline and physical frailty [56]. Also supportive is the finding showing the enhancement of brain plasticity in older adults following physical training [55, 59,60,61]. Specifically, Suo et al. showed that 6-month resistance training improved not only overall cognitive performance but also elicited GM expansion for participants at risk for dementia [55]. This study, together with ours, suggests that the relationship between muscular fitness and mental health may be mediated by increased GMV in regions having high plasticity like the hippocampus. The reported link between grip strength and cognition aligns with previous studies [13, 15, 45], which suggests that grip strength may serve as a complementary measure of cognitive ability in aging adults. Going beyond limited domains or insensitive cognitive measures, we investigated a broader constellation of cognitive metrics spanning domains of memory, executive function, reasoning, and processing speed that are sensitive to subtle, early changes related to aging. In addition, we investigated several behavioral measures that are closely related to health status but have never been directly related to grip strength [12]. Of the 30 behavioral outcomes examined here, reaction time, which reflects cognitive domains of processing speed [37], demonstrated the most robust association with grip strength. As suggested by Joesh et al. [8], the strong association may be partially explained by the high dependence of the reaction time task on motor speed and dexterity, which are closely related to muscular function of hands. Further, in contrast to other behavioral outcomes that were based on self-report, the cognitive task-measured reaction time scores may be more informative in capturing inter-individual variability. Moreover, according to the general slowing theory, the decline in reaction time is a leading and sensitive indicator of cognitive aging and can lead to decrements in other domains like executive functions and working memory [46]. Deficits in processing speed have been observed across many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders [47, 48], and recent work in the UK Biobank suggests that the association between grip strength and reaction time is weaker in individuals with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder relative to the general population [8, 9]. In addition, we found that the associations between grip strength and mental health outcomes were stronger in females than in males, implying distinct mechanisms between them. Consistently, a recent study [49] based on Mendelian randomization analysis also identified shared pathways between grip strength and depression in females but not in males. In light of this, it is of interest for future investigations to ascertain any gender specificity of the beneficial effects stemming from physical exercise aiming at enhancing muscular fitness. Our study also provides evidence for the directionality of the connection between grip strength and mental health. Specifically, the longitudinal analyses showed that baseline grip strength was related to cognitive performance at ~9 years follow-up, while the reverse effect was much weaker, and a significant bi-directional relationship was only found for reaction time. This is consistent with most longitudinal findings that implicate stronger grip strength as a protective factor against cognitive decline and dementia [13, 14, 52, 53] but also supports the notion that changes in these two constructs parallel each other over time [19, 54]. This finding supports the utility of grip strength as a potential treatment target for improved cognitive outcomes in older adults. Indeed, a recent intervention study found that 6 months of resistance training, but not computerized cognitive training, can significantly improve global cognition in older patients with dementia [55]. The bi-directional relationship was also encouraging as they implied that interventions that enhance either muscular fitness or cognitive capabilities may generate beneficial effects on the other [3, 19]. Furthermore, we demonstrated significant paths from baseline neuroticism, health and financial satisfaction to subsequent grip strength. As these measures were pertinent to mental health and life satisfaction, it may suggest that people with greater resilience and satisfaction were more likely to engage in physical activities [19]. Together, the behavioral analyses emphasized the need for increased awareness in clinical practice to incorporate muscular strength into routine assessment and provided insights into possible interventions to prevent cognitive decline during aging.",https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02490-2,False,
"What we found is that with strength training, people were able to remember things better.","But an encouraging new study suggests that our muscles remember.

It found that muscles developed a pervasive and lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helped them bounce back quickly from long layoffs. Our bodies remember how. But this type of memory, while real, is not really a muscle memory. These memories exist within motor neurons in our brains. But scientists knew that something happened within muscles themselves when they were worked hard, especially during weight training, and that these changes affected how muscles later responded to exercise. “Anecdotally, people say things like, ‘I used to be an athlete, then took time off, but my muscles came back as soon as I started’” lifting weights again, said Kevin Murach, a professor of health and human performance at the University of Arkansas, who oversaw the new study.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal survival and growth, serves as a neurotransmitter modulator, and participates in neuronal plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory. It is widely expressed in the CNS, gut and other tissues. BDNF binds to its high affinity receptor TrkB (tyrosine kinase B) and activates signal transduction cascades (IRS1/2, PI3K, Akt), crucial for CREB and CBP production, that encode proteins involved in β cell survival.

"As you do that, mild kinds are released, mild kinds go into the brain, and then mild kinds encourage the brain to produce BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain.","Neuroplasticity is used to describe this tendency for the brain to keep developing, changing, and potentially healing itself. As you release BDNF, your genes “turn on” new brain cell growth, the more BDNF you have the quicker you learn, the more you remember, the less your brain ages and you actually reshape your brain. Every stressful situation in your life, from work to home, slightly damages your brain cells. B.D.N.F. actually increases the plasticity of your brain so it actually minimizes the impact of stress on brain cells. Think of brain-derived neurotrophic factors as fertilizer for your brain. You have billions of neurons (aka cells), and BDNF keeps them flourishing and strong. When you release BDNF, it flips the switch on a series of genes that grow brand-new cells and pathways. BDNF also strengthens the neurons you already have. Along with keeping you mentally alert and improving memory high BDNF carries many other benefits, too. It should come as no surprise that both the quality and duration of your sleep increase BDNF. The deeper stages of sleep stages 3 and 4, increases BDNF release.

"BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain helps preserve brain cells.","Brain derived neurotrophic factor is synthesized as the precursor proBDNF, that can be stored in either dendrites or axons (Lessmann et al., 2003), and undergoes cleavage intra or extracellularly (Lee et al., 2001; Mowla et al., 2001) to produce a mature BDNF protein. BDNF is released in an activity dependent manner as a mixture of pro and mature BDNF (Pang et al., 2004). Interestingly, BDNF and proBDNF are associated with opposing effects on cellular function, which gives BDNF protein function an additional level of complexity. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a key molecule involved in plastic changes related to learning and memory. The expression of BDNF is highly regulated, and can lead to great variability in BDNF levels in healthy subjects. Changes in BDNF expression are associated with both normal and pathological aging and also psychiatric disease, in particular in structures important for memory processes such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas.
