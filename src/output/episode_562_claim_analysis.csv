2465110,I do a lot of writing in my day job as a journalist and an author.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465112,What I'm writing now is not for publication or for sharing with anyone else.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465113,"Now it's called expressive writing and despite the name, it can be done with pen and paper or on the computer as I'm doing now.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465114,"The idea is you put aside 15 minutes to write about your deepest emotions and the thoughts you have about the things that are keeping you up at night, worrying you.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465115,Studies have shown that doing this can have some surprising health benefits.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465126,How often do you find you just can't stop thinking about something?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465127,It's usually most days at the moment.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465128,I think it's due to the fact that I'm just so busy and there is just so much to do during the day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465129,My mind is just full.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465130,What work do you do?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465131,I work for the NHS.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465132,"Right, so it's pretty stressful at the best of times.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465133,"It's very challenging at the moment, yes.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465134,"I work in a non-clinical role, so I'm not patient-facing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465135,"But even so, there is a lot to do on a day-to-day basis.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465136,"And then when we finish our work, there's obviously the challenges of running a family in a home as well.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465137,So how many kids have you got?,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465138,I've just got one boy.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465139,He's 14.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465140,Those are the stressful years.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465141,I do remember they become challenging.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465142,"And you also worry about them, don't you?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465143,Absolutely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465144,They're at such a critical stage in their lives and you worry how that is all going to end up.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465145,Absolutely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465146,"All I can say is, on the whole, they turn out well.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465147,But it doesn't feel like it at the time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465148,Thank you.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465149,That's good to know.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465150,"Well, I'm going to ask you to set aside 15 minutes on three separate occasions over the next week to write down your thoughts and feelings.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465151,"This sort of expressive writing has all sorts of benefits for your mood, your immune system, and even your memory.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465152,And you should start to feel the benefits within a week.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465153,Sounds good.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465154,I'll give it a go.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465155,I've asked Julie to write down her thoughts over the next week.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465156,"And that's because expressive writing can be surprisingly beneficial for your brain, your wellbeing, and your life.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465157,"Now, you might think that focusing on things that have gone wrong and writing about them would make things worse.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465158,But the opposite seems to be true.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465159,"Research suggests that expressive writing can, in fact, reduce negative thoughts.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465160,And boost your mood.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465161,And it doesn't take long.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465162,"In one study, people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions not only found that doing so improved the quality of their sleep, but it also reduced how often they had negative thoughts.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465163,"Of course, if you've just experienced a significant trauma or are feeling completely overwhelmed, it would be advisable to go to your GP or another health professional.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465164,"But if it's low-level anxiety, the sort of thoughts that are keeping you up at night, expressive writing really could help.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465165,And it may even boost your brain power.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465166,"Studies have shown that doing expressive writing before an exam can improve performance by offloading, distracting worrisome thoughts, and freeing up working memory.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465167,And the benefits don't seem to be simply psychological.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465168,"Recent studies have shown some surprising benefits of expressive writing on your physical health, such as your immune system.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465169,"Researchers in New Zealand, for example, asked a group of medical students to write about personal traumatic events the day before they were vaccinated.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465170,"Amazingly, six months after receiving the vaccine, these students had a stronger immune response and far higher antibody levels than a control group who merely had the vaccine.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465171,"Randomised controlled trials, the gold standard of studies, have also shown that asthma patients use less medication and arthritis patients feel less pain after doing expressive writing.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465172,"And encouragingly for patients recovering from cancer treatments, a small randomised controlled trial found that patients with early-stage breast cancer reported fewer coughs, headaches, less chest pain and stomach upset, and attended fewer cancer-related medical appointments in the months after they had written about their feelings compared to a control group.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465173,Professor James Pennebaker was the first scientist to investigate how expressive writing can benefit health back in the 1980s.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465174,I'll be speaking to him later in the programme.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465175,"First, let's find out how Julie is getting on with her writing challenge.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465176,I've just written my first expressive writing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465177,It surprised me how much I've actually written and I have gone over the 15 minutes and didn't realise.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465178,I'm quite surprised how much I have written and how frank and honest it actually looks as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465179,I don't usually write during the day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465180,Usually I'm typing at a computer screen or using my mobile phone so to actually pick up a pen was actually quite nice and the words just did seem to flow.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465181,"Wow, I'm glad that Julie got out her pen and wrote those thoughts away.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465182,We'll catch up with her again at the end of the week and see if she's still enjoying writing enough to make it just one thing she'll keep up.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465183,"But now to find out more about why expressive writing is so powerful, I'm speaking to the man who started it all, Professor James Pennebaker from the University of Texas, Austin.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465184,"Dr Pennebaker, tell me about that first study.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465185,"I was curious if writing about upsetting topics that people had kept secret, if that could be beneficial.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465186,"So the study, we brought people in the lab one at a time.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465187,We gave them instructions to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings about this upsetting experience that they hadn't talked much with others about.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465188,They would write for 15 minutes and then they'd come back the next day.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465189,We had another group running at the same time.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465190,They were asked to write about superficial topics.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465191,And then we simply just tracked how often they went to the doctor over the next several months.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465192,And what we found was that people who wrote about these traumatic experience ended up going to the doctor at far lower rates than people in our control conditions.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465193,Wow.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465194,Did they share what they were writing with others or was it intended to remain a secret but written down?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465195,We told them that we wanted to keep what they'd written and we would never connect it with who they were.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465196,They didn't read it to us or anybody else.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465197,"Right, because in standard therapy, you're supposed to talk it out.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465198,"But in this case, it was enough just to write it down.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465199,And they were asked to write about some of the most traumatic experiences of their lives.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465200,Did it have to be a major trauma to work?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465201,No.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465202,"What I usually ask people to do is, I want you to write about any experience that you're worried about that keeps recurring in your mind.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465203,"So, do you think it's that expressive writing in some ways helping clear your mind?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465204,"You know, there was a couple of really interesting studies looking at this several years ago.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465205,There's a phenomenon called working memory.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465206,Working memory is how your mind is constantly thinking about things.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465207,"And if you're under stress, you're not able to take in other information.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465208,You're more forgetful.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465209,You don't sleep as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465210,What these researchers found was that expressive writing increased working memory.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465211,People were now able to think more clearly.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465212,They did better at university in terms of their grades.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465213,They slept better.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465214,"We know that when somebody is stressed and they're obsessing about things, their heart beats faster, their immune system is suppressed.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465215,"And when a person writes about an upsetting experience, you find certain enhancements in immune activity that the immune system is working more efficiently.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465216,Wow.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465217,Can you tell me what you think the mechanism is?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465218,Did it lead to measurable changes in the body?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465219,So there have been several studies looking at this.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465220,They do what's called a punch biopsy.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465221,It's a small five millimeter punch in your skin.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465222,And they look and see how long it takes to heal.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465223,And what they do in these studies is they have people write about emotional upheavals in the days prior to this punch procedure.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465224,"And with expressive writing, people heal more quickly than if they're writing about superficial topics.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465225,And what's particularly intriguing is they're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465226,"But they're also finding it with these more elegant immune markers, hormones and peptides that are associated with the healing process itself.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465227,How big are the studies?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465228,"I mean, are they convincing?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465229,Part of it is you have to look at how many studies have been done.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465230,There have been a couple of thousand studies.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465231,"In most of the studies, you find improvements in physical health.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465232,"But the effects are, they are modest.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465233,"What's so striking about this is that we're only asking them to write, say, 15 minutes a day for three or four days.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465234,"As an intervention, it's free, it's fast, it's easy.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465235,Does this kind of writing also benefit your social life?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465236,"Yes, it does.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465237,"What we found was that people who wrote about this upsetting experience, their social behaviors changed.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465238,"A month later, they were talking more with others.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465239,They were more socially engaged.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465240,They laughed more.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465241,"One reason that this can be so powerful is that when you write, you get these upsetting experiences out of your mind.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465242,You're now able to connect with other people better.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465243,You're able to listen to them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465244,You're able to be a better friend.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465245,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465246,"So if I want to undertake it, can you talk me through how I start?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465247,"First of all, I'm not here to sell you a bona fide, copyrighted system.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465248,Experiment and see what works best for you.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465249,Set aside three or four days.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465250,Find 10 or 15 minutes and just sit down and write.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465251,And the only rule I have is to write continuously.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465252,Don't worry about grammar or sentence structure or spelling.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465253,"And in fact, plan to throw it away afterwards.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465254,I discovered a method several years ago that I call finger writing.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465255,Just writing with my finger in the air.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465256,That also works quite well.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465257,"And if after two or three days you find that you're not benefiting from this at all, then stop writing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465258,Do something else.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465259,"You know, go jogging.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465260,"This is not one true way, but it's a remarkably effective system.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465261,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465262,That's the science.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465263,Time to check in with Julie.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465264,Let's find out if expressive writing is something she'll carry on with.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465265,I really enjoyed the three sessions.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465266,I did find it was more beneficial to write on an evening before bedtime.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465267,It just felt as though I was able to just clear my mind and my thoughts.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465268,"And I did actually have an uninterrupted sleep that evening, which was great.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465269,"I really enjoyed the part where I was able to just spend some time by myself and download my thoughts and feelings and just create some space, really.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465270,I've actually signed up for a creative writing course.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465271,"So yeah, really enjoyed it",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465272,and I will be taking it forward.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465273,I am really glad to hear that Julie has got so much out of her writing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465274,And I've been doing it all week,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465275,and I do think it's made a difference.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465276,Perhaps helped my sleep a bit.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465277,Today I'm trying Professor Pennebaker's finger writing method.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465278,I've decided to come to my local woods and I'm here to wave my finger in the air.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465279,It's always nice to have an excuse to come outside.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465280,"If you haven't heard it yet, check out our Green Spaces episode from Series 1 on BBC Sounds.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465281,"I do think taking up something like expressive writing can be really worth it, especially if you're a bit anxious and you don't need a computer or pen to do it and your relationships, your brain and your immune system could benefit.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465282,So that's it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465290,From uncovering the unconscious reason we shake hands.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
