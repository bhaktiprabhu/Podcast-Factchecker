        "An American study found that muscle mass is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more than weight or body mass index.",
        "And by maintaining muscle mass, you can also reduce your risk of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions.",
        "And chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions actually do increase your risk for developing cognitive impairment and dementia.",
        "And finally, strength training can do good things for your brain power.",
        "And it appears that strength training can also directly impact both your brain function and brain structure.",
        "And specifically, what we call associative memory, such that today is the first time I've met you.",
        "And the parts of the muscle cells that generate energy, the mitochondria are actually really important benefits as we age.",
        "Lifting weights can also benefit your metabolism, your waistline and even your blood sugars.",
        "Recent evidence suggests that muscle-strengthening exercises for only a few minutes a day can confer some remarkable health benefits, boosting your immune system and even your brain.",
        "Researchers found that those who had more muscle mass were at a lower risk of death from all causes.",
        "So, it's been shown that strength training can improve your memory, as well as your more complex cognitive abilities, such as decision making.",
        "Strength training may even reverse ageing at a cellular level.",
        "That said, there are lots of benefits of incorporating a bit of strength training into your life.",
        "That's partly because building muscle increases your insulin sensitivity, improving your ability to lower your blood sugar levels after a meal.",
        "strength training's most widely known benefits include the maintenance of your muscle mass, as well as your muscle strength and your bone health."

        "And in two studies, we found that strength training had benefits for both the cognitive function, as well as metrics acquired on neuroimaging.",
        "Apart from making you look more toned, building your muscles could help you live longer.",
        "BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which, as I understand it, is like a sort of fertilizer for the brain helps preserve brain cells.",
        "But certainly one of the main mechanisms there's evidence for is a release of what we call neurotrophic factors.",
        "There is a brain-derived neurotrophic factors, as well as insulin growth factor one.",
        "We also found that with strength training, people had better executive functions, meaning that people were able to make the appropriate decision based on the circumstance presented to people.",
        "What we found is that with strength training, people were able to remember things better."
