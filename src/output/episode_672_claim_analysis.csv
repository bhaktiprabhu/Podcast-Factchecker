2434682,"During the chaos of the Trump years, the big running joke was that the New York Times kept reporting about UFOs, and that was still one of the least shocking news events during that chaotic time.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2434683,"And so how did you get, as a longtime reporter for the Times, how did you get into the UFO",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2434684,And how did you get UFOs on the front page of the New York Times in 2020?,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434685,"Well, 2017, it started.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434686,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434687,"But 2020 was the big, like, gasp reveal.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434688,Yeah.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434689,"Well, we got it in in 2020 because we had broken the ground in 2017 with that big front page story about ATIP, you know, the secret Pentagon unit that was investigating UFOs that no one knew about until we broke the story on the front page of the Times.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434690,"After that, we had some follow ups, including in 2020, where we talked about close encounters, close calls, Navy jets almost colliding with some of these UFOs.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434691,"And finally, we just kind of broke the story that Congress or committees in Congress were briefed on materials, OK, quote, very difficult story to get, and we can talk about that in more detail.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434692,"You know, and that was in the height of the Trump craziness, breaking that story.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434693,So but that that was really the trajectory.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434694,We did a number of stories starting in 2017.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434695,And how did your colleagues react to you working on these stories all these years?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434696,"Well, we're mixed.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434697,"You know, we were the butt of some jokes, some joking in the Washington bureau, particularly Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434698,She was and is the Pentagon correspondent.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434699,So she took some heat from her colleagues.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434700,"They would go, you know, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, you know, when she would pass in the newsroom.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434701,"But when she showed some of the videos that we had gotten from the Navy that showed these UFOs and we actually broke, you know, the news of these videos in The New York Times, when she pulled some of those up on her computer, everybody, you know, in the Washington bureau crowded around and they were they were mesmerized.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434702,They wanted to see that.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434703,"Oh, my God, what's that?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434704,"So I think basically, we had got a lot of support from our colleagues.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434705,"Yeah, I mean, it's a tough, taboo subject.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434706,And you can just define for our listeners what exactly are UFOs?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434707,"Well, UAP is really what the Pentagon likes to call them, unidentified aerial phenomena, UFOs, unidentified flying objects.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2434708,"And, you know, people say, do you believe in UFOs?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2434709,You don't have to believe in UFOs.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434710,They're unidentified.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434711,"You know, there's something up there that they can't identify.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434712,"And some of them, you know, a number have been explained, can be explained.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434713,"You know, various natural phenomena, clouds, you know, all kinds of things.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434714,But a great number of them cannot.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434715,"And the big the last big Pentagon, you know, investigation, Operation Blue Book, which ended in 1969, which concluded, you know, that it was nothing to see here.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434716,But there were 701 cases left on the table that they couldn't explain.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434717,"So, you know, add to those 701 cases, then thousands since then.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434718,"And you know, we're left with we're left with a big mystery.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434719,These things.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434720,And now the Pentagon says that they're real.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434721,"I mean, we don't know what they are.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434722,"Nobody knows what they are, where they come from, what they want.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434723,"You know, what intelligence, if any, is behind the wheel.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434724,"But at least now the government is saying, well, these things have a physicality.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434725,They're real.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434726,They're not a hallucination.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434727,They're not a mistake.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434728,"You know, they're not a fraud or a hoax.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434729,"So in that sense, we've come a long way.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434730,A recent government report said that it can't be ruled out that they're not aliens.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434731,"From all the reporting you've done, all the conversations you had, how likely do you think some of these UAPs, UFOs, are aliens?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434732,"Well, you know, that's a question that the government just won't address, by the way.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434733,They don't go there.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434734,And I understand that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434735,It's one step at a time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434736,And it is pure speculation.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434737,"But if you figure that the aerodynamics of these objects are not like anything seen on Earth, that we, the American government, the experts, don't believe that any earthly adversary is capable of this kind of advanced technology.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434738,"I mean, these things had no, you know, aerodynamic surfaces, no wings, no tails, no propellers, no exhaust, no sound, no rivets.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434739,"You know, I mean, it just defied explanation.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434740,"And certainly these objects seemed not to be anything that anyone on Earth was capable of in terms of their speed, their maneuverability, their ability to disappear and appear, operate even underwater in some cases.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434741,"They seem to go into the water and out of the water, not just the atmosphere.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434742,"So then you say, well, who could be behind these?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434743,"I mean, that's pure speculation.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434744,But one of the possibilities would have to be that there's some kind of alien intelligence operating them either robotically or on board.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434745,"But I mean, you cannot exclude that possibility, obviously.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434746,So that's where we're left.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434747,"I mean, you know, nobody has the proof.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434748,Nobody has any evidence.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434749,"These whoever, whatever might be behind these things has not been caught on, you know, any recording device.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434750,So it remains a mystery.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434751,"When I bring this topic up, as I like to do, I always point folks to your reporting and all the work that you've done in this area.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434752,I get the pushback.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434753,"Well, if there is intelligent life, there are such a thing as aliens among us visiting Earth.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434754,What would they possibly what would an advanced intelligence possibly want with us?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434755,"Yeah, that's a good question.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434756,"You know, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote when he was asked this question in different ways, he had a good answer.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434757,"He said, you know, I'm a human psychiatrist.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434758,I'm not an alien psychiatrist.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434759,"I cannot figure out their motivations, you know, what they might be thinking or why they you know, why did they appear in this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434760,"There was some kind of a landing, according to 60 school kids who saw it.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434761,But no adults saw it at the time.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434762,"So people kept saying, well, how come no adults saw this?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434763,"You know, 60 kids at recess all saw this craft land and two beings as they described it later.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434764,And they drew pictures and all the kids sort of agreed.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434765,"I mean, not exactly.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434766,"It wasn't a story that they all subscribed to, but they told us similar accounts.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434767,And these were very innocent kids.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434768,They weren't conniving together to make up a story.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434769,"And when they went to John Mack and said, well, how come no adults, you know, the aliens picked the one time when the kids were at recess and no adults were present?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434770,"You know, how do you explain that?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434771,"And he said, look, I'm not an alien psychiatrist.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434772,"You know, I can't I can't explain these things.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434773,It's just what the kids reported.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434774,"So what they want from us, if they're so if there's technology so superior, are we are they curious the way we are curious about animals, you know, inferior forms of life that they would like to study?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434775,Who knows?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434776,"But as I said, the important thing is that these objects forget about aliens because we don't know about aliens, but the objects themselves are real.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434777,So there are things in the atmosphere that seem to be under intelligent control that we cannot explain that much.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434778,We now think we know.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434779,"So, you know, why they do it this way, why they're here, all good questions.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434780,"And how likely is it that it could be China, Russia or any or Israel or any other country?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434781,"Yeah, very unlike I mean, to the point of impossible.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434782,"I mean, again, based on the look, I mean, there are drones around.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434783,"We know that there's some very sophisticated technology flying around the balloon episode that we recently, you know, were privy to the Chinese called Weather Balloon, Surveillance Balloon, whatever it was, floating into our atmosphere territory.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434784,"So there is some sophisticated technology out there, that's for sure.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434785,"But that doesn't explain the kind of things that pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434786,"But they encountered these things and they are the most they were the most sophisticated, you know, technologically gifted observers we have in this country.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434787,"The subject, you know, the recipient of millions of dollars of training and and expertise.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434788,"And they saw these things, tic-tacs, they called them.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434789,"And that didn't did not seem possible that they could be Chinese technology or Russian or Iranian or Israeli, just not possible, given what we know of the the physics and the ability we have or we understand to the way objects move.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434790,It just does not seem possible.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434791,"So that's why the experts that we've talked to at The New York Times, that The New York Times has talked to in the Pentagon and, you know, for our reporting have all said that it is unlikely to the point of impossibility that at least all these things can be explained by earthly adversaries.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434792,Because they tend to defy the laws of physics as we know them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434793,As we as we understand them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434794,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434795,"I mean, physicists will tell you you can't defy the laws of physics.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434796,"You know, those are the natural laws.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434797,"But it's as we understand the laws of physics, physics, you know, laws.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434798,"I mean, before Einstein, we thought physics took certain forms.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434799,"After Einstein, we realized that it took other forms.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434800,So we may not just understand all the possibilities.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434801,"You'd have to be a moron to think we understand everything there is to know about physics right now, that there's nothing left to find out.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434802,"No, no serious person will tell you that.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434803,"There's a lot we still don't understand, a huge amount, obviously.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434804,"So there may be things that could explain the movements, you know, the operations of these objects.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434805,But we don't understand that yet.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434806,It's certainly a Galileo moment that challenges the conventional thinking and deals with all sorts of skepticism out there.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434807,Absolutely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434808,"One explanation I heard from a researcher at the Pentagon or had been at the Pentagon for some time, one theory is that the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them, one of the reasons why they want nothing to do with us, it's the same sort of question.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434809,"If you were to go back in time and suddenly find yourself among a bunch of, I would say, like Templar knights during the Crusades or people are being burned alive and just the savagery of human beings, basically, that this other life form is just so advanced compared to us that they don't really want to mess with us.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434810,"So, you know, like you use the animal reference, but it's also a time traveler not wanting to spook the people of the Middle Ages at risk of, you know, being harmed, being burned at the stake or whatever.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434811,"And also this person touched on the fact, saying that there's a lot of interest around water with these crafts.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434812,There's a lot of sightings around water.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434813,There tends to be some of the crafts.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434814,And that there's a theory that maybe Earth is just a far flung fueling station for them to go to other places.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434815,"Yeah, there was a lot in that question, Andrea.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434816,"Well, this is like a therapeutic conversation for me.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434817,I can finally talk to somebody.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434818,"You know, you say, well, they want nothing to do with us.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434819,"And yet they, whatever they, whoever they are, are here.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434820,"You know, I mean, they're all over the place.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434821,"They've been sighted in every country on Earth, just about every continent to all kinds of people for a very long time.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434822,"So if they don't want anything to do with us, why don't they just stay away from Earth?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434823,"But there's something that that draws these these things, you know, to to our area of the of the galaxy of the universe.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434824,"So, you know, why they're here, I mean, that's a good question.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434825,"They certainly have not gone out of their way to announce themselves or I shouldn't say that they have announced themselves, but they haven't made themselves transparent or clear what what they want, whatever it is they haven't, you know, introduced themselves to our leaders as far as we know, although there's a lot of stories out there about, you know, strange collaborations with American government, which, you know, you can find on the Internet.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434826,We can we can try to unpack that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434827,There's certainly no evidence of that.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434828,There's just stories.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434829,"But anyway, you know, that's really one of the mysteries.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434830,"Why, if they don't want anything to do with us, why are they here?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434831,"What do they want if they're so advanced that they can, you know, master this kind of technology?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434832,What do they want with us?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434833,Maybe there's something missing from them that they're looking for in us.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434834,"Well, did John Mackett close to answering that?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434835,He didn't get close.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434836,He raised a lot of good questions.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434837,What he what he did is he compiled a lot of data from people who consulted him.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434838,I don't even want to call them patients because there was nothing wrong with them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434839,"OK, but hundreds of people told their stories to John Mack about encounters that they believed they had and not only believed, but that they that in some cases third parties confirmed they had with these beings, whatever you want to call them.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434840,So he compiled a lot of data.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434841,He never figured it out.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434842,"And all he did was provide a kind of a good database of experiences that people recounted to him, you know, both consciously and sometimes under deep, you know, under relaxation techniques.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434843,He wasn't a big fan of hypnosis like like Bud Hopkins and other people.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434844,"But anyway, he got all these accounts and they were very, very similar accounts.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434845,"They were not similar to the point that, you know, everybody was telling one story that they kind of agreed on.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434846,But there was a similarity to the stories that convinced him that they had all experienced something that could not be explained.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434847,"But in the end, again, you know, you got to come away from this phenomenon with great humility.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2434848,It remains unexplained.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
