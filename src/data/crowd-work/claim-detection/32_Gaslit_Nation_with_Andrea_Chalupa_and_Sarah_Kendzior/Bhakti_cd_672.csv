2434683,"And so how did you get, as a longtime reporter for the New York Times, how did you get into the UFO",FALSE,
2434684,"And so how did you get, as a longtime reporter for the New York Times, how did you get into the UFO And how did you get UFOs on the front page of the New York Times in 2020?",FALSE,
2434685,"Well, 2017, it started.",FALSE,
2434686,Right.,FALSE,
2434687,"But 2020 was the big, like, gasp reveal.",FALSE,
2434688,Yeah.,FALSE,
2434689,"Well, we got UFOs in in 2020 because we had broken the ground in 2017 with that big front page story about ATIP, you know, the secret Pentagon unit that was investigating UFOs that no one knew about until we broke the story on the front page of the New York Times.",FALSE,
2434690,"After that, we had some follow ups, including in 2020, where we talked about close encounters, close calls, Navy jets almost colliding with some of these UFOs.",FALSE,
2434691,"And finally, we just kind of broke the story that Congress or committees in Congress were briefed on materials, OK, quote, very difficult story to get, and we can talk about the story that Congress or committees in Congress were briefed on materials, OK, quote, very difficult story to get in more detail.",FALSE,
2434692,"You know, and that was in the height of the Trump craziness, breaking the story that Congress or committees in Congress were briefed on materials, OK, quote, very difficult story to get.",FALSE,
2434693,So but that that was really the trajectory.,FALSE,
2434694,We did a number of stories starting in 2017.,FALSE,
2434695,And how did your colleagues react to you working on a number of stories all these years?,FALSE,
2434696,"Well, your colleagues're mixed.",FALSE,

2434698,"Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story was and is the Pentagon correspondent.",FALSE,

2434700,"her colleagues would go, you know, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, you know, when Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story would pass in the newsroom.",FALSE,
2434701,"But when Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story showed some of the videos that we had gotten from Navy that showed these UFOs and we actually broke, you know, the news of the videos that we had gotten from the Navy that showed these UFOs in the New York Times, when Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story pulled some of the videos that we had gotten from the Navy that showed these UFOs up on Helene Cooper, who collaborated with Leslie Kane and me on the first story's computer, everybody, you know, in the Washington bureau crowded around and everybody, you know, in the Washington bureau were everybody, you know, in the Washington bureau were mesmerized.",FALSE,
2434702,"everybody, you know, in the Washington bureau wanted to see that.",FALSE,
2434703,"Oh, my God, what's that?",FALSE,
2434704,"So I think basically, we had got a lot of support from our colleagues.",FALSE,
2434705,"Yeah, I mean, it's a tough, taboo subject.",FALSE,
2434706,And you can just define for our listeners what exactly are UFOs?,FALSE,
2434707,"Well, UAP is really what Pentagon likes to call UFOs, unidentified aerial phenomena, UFOs, unidentified flying objects.",FALSE,
2434708,"And, you know, people say, do you believe in UFOs?",FALSE,
2434709,You don't have to believe in UFOs.,FALSE,
2434710,UFOs're unidentified.,FALSE,
2434711,"You know, there's something up there that they can't identify.",FALSE,
2434712,"And some of UFOs, you know, a number have been explained, can be explained.",FALSE,
2434713,"You know, various natural phenomena, clouds, you know, all kinds of things.",FALSE,
2434714,But a great number of UFOs cannot.,FALSE,
2434715,"And the big the last big Pentagon, you know, investigation, Operation Blue Book, which ended in 1969, which concluded, you know, that it was nothing to see here.",FALSE,
2434716,But there were 701 cases left on the table that they couldn't explain.,FALSE,
2434717,"So, you know, add to 701 cases left on the table that they couldn't explain, then thousands since then.",FALSE,
2434718,"And you know, we're left with we're left with a big mystery.",FALSE,
2434719,These things.,FALSE,
2434720,And now Pentagon says that these UFOs're real.,TRUE,High
2434721,"I mean, we don't know what UFOs are.",FALSE,
2434722,"Nobody knows what UFOs are, where UFOs come from, what UFOs want.",FALSE,
2434723,"You know, what intelligence, if any, is behind the wheel.",FALSE,
2434724,"But at least now the government is saying, well, these UFOs have a physicality.",TRUE,High
2434725,these UFOs're real.,TRUE,High
2434726,these UFOs're not a hallucination.,TRUE,Medium
2434727,these UFOs're not a mistake.,TRUE,Low
2434728,"You know, these UFOs're not a fraud or a hoax.",TRUE,High
2434729,"So in that sense, we've come a long way.",FALSE,
2434730,A recent government report said that it can't be ruled out that these UFOs're not aliens.,TRUE,High
2434731,"From all the reporting you've done, all the conversations you had, how likely do you think some of these UFOs, are aliens?",FALSE,
2434732,"Well, you know, that's a question that the government just won't address, by the way.",FALSE,
2434733,the government don't go there.,FALSE,
2434734,And I understand that.,FALSE,
2434735,It's one step at a time.,FALSE,
2434736,And it is pure speculation.,FALSE,
2434737,"But if you figure that the aerodynamics of these UFOs are not like anything seen on Earth, that the government, the experts, don't believe that any earthly adversary is capable of this kind of advanced technology.",FALSE,
2434738,"I mean, these UFOs had no, you know, aerodynamic surfaces, no wings, no tails, no propellers, no exhaust, no sound, no rivets.",TRUE,High
2434739,"You know, I mean, it just defied explanation.",FALSE,
2434740,"And certainly these UFOs seemed not to be anything that anyone on Earth was capable of in terms of these UFOs's speed, these UFOs's maneuverability, these UFOs's ability to disappear and appear, operate even underwater in some cases.",FALSE,
2434741,"these UFOs seem to go into the water and out of the water, not just the atmosphere.",TRUE,High
2434742,"So then you say, well, who could be behind these UFOs?",FALSE,
2434743,"I mean, that's pure speculation.",FALSE,
2434744,But one of the possibilities would have to be that there's some kind of alien intelligence operating these UFOs either robotically or on board.,FALSE,
2434745,"But I mean, you cannot exclude that possibility, obviously.",FALSE,
2434746,So that's where we're left.,FALSE,
2434747,"I mean, you know, nobody has the proof.",FALSE,
2434748,Nobody has any evidence.,FALSE,
2434749,"These whoever, whatever might be behind these UFOs has not been caught on, you know, any recording device.",FALSE,
2434750,So it remains a mystery.,FALSE,
2434751,"When I bring this topic up, as I like to do, I always point folks to your reporting and all the work that you've done in this area.",FALSE,
2434752,I get the pushback.,FALSE,
2434753,"Well, if there is intelligent life, there are such a thing as aliens among us visiting Earth.",FALSE,
2434754,What would aliens among us visiting Earth possibly what would an advanced intelligence possibly want with us?,FALSE,
2434755,"Yeah, that's a good question.",FALSE,
2434756,"You know, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote when John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote was asked this question in different ways, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote had a good answer.",FALSE,
2434757,"John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote said, you know, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote'm a human psychiatrist.",FALSE,
2434758,"John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote'm not an alien psychiatrist.",FALSE,
2434759,"John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote cannot figure out UFOs's motivations, you know, what UFOs might be thinking or why UFOs you know, why did UFOs appear in this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995?",FALSE,
2434760,"There was some kind of a landing, according to 60 school kids who saw this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995.",FALSE,
2434761,But no adults saw this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995 at the time.,FALSE,
2434762,"So people kept saying, well, how come no adults saw this famous episode we can talk about in Zimbabwe in 1995?",FALSE,
2434763,"You know, 60 school kids who saw it saw this craft land and two beings as 60 school kids who saw it described it later.",TRUE,Low
2434764,And 60 school kids who saw it drew pictures and 60 school kids who saw it sort of agreed.,FALSE,
2434765,"I mean, not exactly.",FALSE,
2434766,"It wasn't a story that they 60 school kids who saw it subscribed to, but 60 school kids who saw it told us similar accounts.",FALSE,
2434767,And 60 school kids who saw it were very innocent kids.,FALSE,
2434768,60 school kids who saw it weren't conniving together to make up a story.,FALSE,
2434769,"And when 60 school kids who saw it went to John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote and said, well, how come no adults, you know, These things picked the one time when 60 school kids who saw it were at recess and no adults were present?",FALSE,
2434770,"You know, how do you explain that?",FALSE,
2434771,"And John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote said, look, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote'm not an alien psychiatrist.",FALSE,
2434772,"You know, John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote can't John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote can't explain these things.",FALSE,
2434773,It's just what 60 school kids who saw it reported.,FALSE,
2434774,"So what these things want from us, if these things're so if there's technology so superior, are we are these things curious the way we are curious about animals, you know, inferior forms of life that these things would like to study?",FALSE,
2434775,Who knows?,FALSE,
2434776,"But as I said, the important thing is that these UAPs, UFOs forget about aliens because we don't know about aliens, but the objects these UAPs, UFOs are real.",TRUE,High
2434777,So there are things in the atmosphere that seem to be under intelligent control that we cannot explain that much.,TRUE,Medium
2434778,We now think we know.,FALSE,
2434779,"So, you know, why these UAPs, UFOs do it this way, why these UAPs, UFOs're here, all good questions.",FALSE,
2434780,"And how likely is it that it could be China, Russia or any or Israel or any other country?",FALSE,
2434781,"Yeah, very unlike I mean, to the point of impossible.",FALSE,
2434782,"I mean, again, based on the look, I mean, there are drones around.",FALSE,
2434783,"We know that there's some very sophisticated technology flying around the balloon episode that we recently, you know, were privy to China called Weather Balloon, Surveillance Balloon, whatever it was, floating into our atmosphere territory.",FALSE,
2434784,"So there is some sophisticated technology out there, that's for sure.",FALSE,
2434785,"But that doesn't explain the kind of things that pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot's wing person.",FALSE,
2434786,"But pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person encountered these things and pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person are the most pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person were the most sophisticated, you know, technologically gifted observers we have in this country.",FALSE,
2434787,"The subject, you know, the recipient of millions of dollars of training and and expertise.",FALSE,
2434788,"And pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person saw these things, pilots like Dave Fravor, a very highly decorated Navy pilot and Alex Dietrich, his wing person called these things.",FALSE,
2434789,"And that didn't did not seem possible that these objects could be Chinese technology or Russian or Iranian or Israeli, just not possible, given what we know of the the physics and the ability we have or we understand to the way objects move.",FALSE,
2434790,It just does not seem possible.,FALSE,
2434791,"So that's why the experts that we've talked to at The New York Times, that The New York Times has talked to in the Pentagon and, you know, for our reporting have all said that it is unlikely to the point of impossibility that at least all these things can be explained by earthly adversaries.",FALSE,
2434792,Because at least all these things tend to defy the laws of physics as we know the laws of physics as we know them.,FALSE,
2434793,As we as we understand physics.,FALSE,
2434794,Right.,FALSE,
2434795,"I mean, physicists will tell you you can't defy the laws of physics as we know them.",FALSE,
2434796,"You know, the laws of physics are the natural laws.",FALSE,
2434797,"But it's as we understand the laws of physics, physics, you know, laws.",FALSE,
2434798,"I mean, before Einstein, we thought physics took certain forms.",FALSE,
2434799,"After Einstein, we realized that physics took other forms.",FALSE,
2434800,So we may not just understand all the possibilities.,FALSE,
2434801,"You'd have to be a moron to think we understand everything there is to know about physics right now, that there's nothing left to find out.",FALSE,
2434802,"No, no serious person will tell you that.",FALSE,
2434803,"There's a lot we still don't understand, a huge amount, obviously.",FALSE,
2434804,"So there may be things that could explain the movements, you know, the operations of these objects.",FALSE,
2434805,"But we don't understand things that could explain the movements, you know, the operations of these objects yet.",FALSE,
2434806,It's certainly a Galileo moment that challenges the conventional thinking and deals with all sorts of skepticism out there.,FALSE,
2434807,Absolutely.,FALSE,
2434808,"One explanation I heard from a researcher at the Pentagon or had been at the Pentagon for some time, one theory is that the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them, one of the reasons why these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them want nothing to do with us, it's the same sort of question.",FALSE,
2434809,"If you were to go back in time and suddenly find yourself among a bunch of, I would say, like Templar knights during the Crusades or people are being burned alive and just the savagery of human beings, basically, that the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them is just so advanced compared to us that the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them don't really want to mess with us.",FALSE,
2434810,"So, you know, like you use the animal reference, but it's also a time traveler not wanting to spook the people of the Middle Ages at risk of, you know, being harmed, being burned at the stake or whatever.",FALSE,
2434811,"And also a researcher at the Pentagon or had been at the Pentagon for some time touched on the fact, saying that there's a lot of interest around water with these objects.",FALSE,
2434812,There's a lot of sightings around water.,FALSE,
2434813,There tends to be some of these objects.,FALSE,
2434814,And that there's a theory that maybe Earth is just a far flung fueling station for the aliens to go to other places.,FALSE,
2434815,"Yeah, there was a lot in that question, Andrea.",FALSE,
2434816,"Well, this is like a therapeutic conversation for me.",FALSE,
2434817,I can finally talk to somebody.,FALSE,
2434818,"You know, you say, well, the aliens want nothing to do with us.",FALSE,
2434819,"And yet they, whatever the aliens, whoever the aliens are, are here.",FALSE,
2434820,"You know, I mean, they're all over the place.",FALSE,
2434821,"They've been sighted in every country on Earth, just about every continent to all kinds of people for a very long time.",FALSE,
2434822,"So if the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them don't want anything to do with us, why don't the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them just stay away from Earth?",FALSE,
2434823,"But there's something that that draws these things, you know, to to our area of the of the galaxy of the universe.",FALSE,
2434824,"So, you know, why they're here, I mean, that's a good question.",FALSE,
2434825,"these objects certainly have not gone out of these objects's way to announce these objects or Andrea shouldn't say that these objects have announced these objects, but these objects haven't made these objects transparent or clear what what these objects want, whatever it is these objects haven't, you know, introduced these objects to our leaders as far as we know, although there's a lot of stories out there about, you know, strange collaborations with American government, which, you know, you can find on the Internet.",FALSE,
2434826,We can we can try to unpack that.,FALSE,
2434827,There's certainly no evidence of that.,FALSE,
2434828,There's just stories.,FALSE,
2434829,"But anyway, you know, that's really one of the mysteries.",FALSE,
2434830,"Why, if these objects don't want anything to do with us, why are these objects here?",FALSE,
2434831,"What do these things want if these things're so advanced that these things can, you know, master this kind of technology?",FALSE,
2434832,What do these objects want with us?,FALSE,
2434833,Maybe there's something missing from these things that these things're looking for in us.,FALSE,
2434834,"Well, did John Mackett close to answering that?",FALSE,
2434835,John Mackett didn't get close.,FALSE,
2434836,John Mackett raised a lot of good questions.,FALSE,
2434837,What John Mackett what John Mackett did is John Mackett compiled a lot of data from people who consulted John Mackett.,FALSE,
2434838,I don't even want to call people who consulted him patients because there was nothing wrong with people who consulted him.,FALSE,
2434839,"OK, but hundreds of people told hundreds of people's stories to John Mackett about encounters that hundreds of people believed hundreds of people had and not only believed, but that hundreds of people that in some cases third parties confirmed hundreds of people had with these beings, whatever you want to call these objects.",FALSE,
2434840,So John Mackett compiled a lot of data.,FALSE,
2434841,John Mackett never figured a lot of data out.,FALSE,
2434842,"And all John Mackett did was provide a kind of a good database of experiences that people recounted to John Mackett, you know, both consciously and sometimes under deep, you know, under relaxation techniques.",FALSE,
2434843,John Mackett wasn't a big fan of hypnosis like like Bud Hopkins and other people.,FALSE,
2434844,"But anyway, John Mackett got all these accounts and all these accounts were very, very similar accounts.",FALSE,
2434845,"all these accounts were not similar to the point that, you know, everybody was telling one story that they kind of agreed on.",FALSE,
2434846,But there was a similarity to all these accounts that convinced John Mackett that they had all experienced something that could not be explained.,FALSE,
2434847,"But in the end, again, you know, you got to come away from this phenomenon with great humility.",FALSE,
2434848,this phenomenon remains unexplained.,FALSE,
