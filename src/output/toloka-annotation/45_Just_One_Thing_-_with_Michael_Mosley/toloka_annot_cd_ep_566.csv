2465846,"And as you probably guessed, I've just been brushing my teeth.",0,0,
2465847,Now doing this twice a day after using an interdental brush or some floss to remove the bits of debris between my teeth should benefit my overall health in some surprising ways.,0,0,
2465848,"And to see just how good a job I've done, I'm going to chew on a plaque-disclosing tablet.",0,0,

2465852,"Oh god, that's not good.",0,0,
2465853,There's lots of kind of blue in my mouth and a particularly big bit of blue between my teeth.,0,0,
2465854,a particularly big bit of blue between my teeth must be an area where I missed when I was brushing.,0,0,
2465855,But at least I am giving it a go.,0,0,
2465856,"Here in the UK, a quarter of all adults don't brush a quarter of all adults's teeth twice a day.",0,0,
2465857,"And when it comes to men, it is one in three who don't.",0,0,
2465858,"Good dental hygiene has some obvious advantages, such as preventing cavities.",0,0,
2465859,"But beyond teeth, studies have shown that brushing and using interdental brushes on those tricky to reach bits may reduce your risk of stroke, stave off dementia and benefit your overall health.",0,0,
2465860,"So better brushing, better health.",0,0,
2465861,I'm speaking to Laurie from North Wales.,0,0,
2465862,Let's see if improving Laurie from North Wales's dental hygiene is just one thing Laurie from North Wales'd like to focus on.,0,0,
2465863,"Hello, Laurie from North Wales.",0,0,
2465864,Hi.,0,0,
2465865,Do Laurie from North Wales have good teeth or is a like mine full of fillings?,0,0,
2465866,Full of fillings.,0,0,
2465867,"They're not too bad, but yeah, there's definitely a few issues with them.",0,0,
2465868,OK.,0,0,
2465869,So tell mine about Laurie from North Wales's tooth brushing technique.,0,0,
2465870,"Try and hit all areas, Laurie from North Wales think.",0,0,
2465871,"Laurie from North Wales do it twice a day, do Laurie from North Wales?",0,0,
2465872,Not every day.,0,0,
2465873,Definitely once a day.,0,0,
2465874,And do Laurie from North Wales ever floss or use interdental brushes to get the little bits out?,0,0,
2465875,No.,0,0,
2465876,No. What about late night snacks?,0,0,
2465877,"Yes, Laurie from North Wales definitely do like a late night snack.",0,0,
2465878,So do Laurie from North Wales make sure to brush Laurie from North Wales's teeth before Laurie from North Wales go to bed?,0,0,
2465879,After Laurie from North Wales've had Laurie from North Wales's late night snack?,0,0,
2465880,Not every time.,0,0,
2465881,No.,0,0,
2465882,No. mine are very honest.,0,0,
2465883,Laurie from North Wales like that.,0,0,
2465884,So mine have a simple but important challenge for Laurie from North Wales this week.,0,0,
2465885,I want Laurie from North Wales to brush Laurie from North Wales's teeth twice a day for two minutes.,0,0,
2465886,Do it once when Laurie from North Wales wake and once before bed after that snack.,0,0,
2465887,"And do make sure Laurie from North Wales use the interdental brush at least once a day, preferably in the evening.",0,0,
2465888,It won't take much of Laurie from North Wales's time.,0,0,
2465889,Do Laurie from North Wales think Laurie from North Wales can manage that?,0,0,
2465890,Definitely.,0,0,
2465891,"Yeah, Laurie from North Wales can definitely do that.",0,0,
2465892,mine've asked Laurie from North Wales to focus on Laurie from North Wales's pearly white smile this week because preventing the buildup of bacteria in your gums can have big long-term benefits.,0,0,
2465893,"Although some bacteria in your mouth are helpful, the ones that cause gum disease can affect your whole body, causing damage in organs far away from your mouth.",0,0,
2465894,"For example, keeping your gums in good shape can benefit your heart.",0,0,
2465895,"According to a huge study conducted on over 10,000 men and women from the Scottish Health Survey, people who brush people who brush their teeth twice a day's teeth twice a day have lower rates of heart disease than those who brush once a day or less.",0,0,
2465896,Why?,0,0,
2465897,"Well, one suggestion is that when bacteria from your mouth leak into your blood, leak activates an immune response.",0,0,
2465898,"In the short term, that can be helpful.",0,0,
2465899,"But if it continues, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which damages the heart.",0,0,
2465900,"These bacteria can also damage the inner lining of your blood vessels, increasing fatty buildup, which in turn can affect blood flow to your vital organs.",0,0,
2465901,Good oral hygiene could also help your body in your body's battle against diseases like COVID.,0,0,
2465902,"An Egyptian study, which looked at over 300 patients who had recovered from COVID, found that people with healthy gums were less likely to be severely affected.",0,0,
2465903,"Another study found that COVID patients with gum disease were over three times as likely to be admitted to intensive care, and COVID patients with gum disease were nine times as likely to die from COVID.",0,0,
2465904,Another really good reason for keeping your teeth and gums in good shape is doing so may also protect your brain.,0,0,
2465905,A recent study of stroke patients revealed that over 80% had blood clots that showed the presence of oral bacteria.,0,0,
2465906,"And another study showed that people who have severe periodontal disease, that's inflamed gums, are also at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease.",0,0,
2465907,mine'll be speaking to a scientist about this surprising mouth-brain connection in a moment.,0,0,
2465908,"But first, let's check in with Laurie from North Wales to see how Laurie from North Wales's getting on with the challenge.",0,0,
2465909,"So Laurie from North Wales'm about halfway through the week and Laurie from North Wales's teeth look amazing, the best my teeth've looked in a long time.",0,0,
2465910,Laurie from North Wales'm enjoying doing it in the evenings.,0,0,
2465911,It feels like self-care.,0,0,
2465912,It's quite nice to take that time out and sit there and use the interdental brushes.,0,0,
2465913,"Lori've stuck to cleaning Lori's teeth twice a day, every single day.",0,0,
2465914,"It's actually helped Lori with the snacking, because obviously once Lori've done Lori's teeth, Lori then end up not snacking in the evening, so that's been great.",0,0,
2465915,"So yeah, really enjoying the challenge and really pleased with how the challenge's going.",0,0,
2465916,"It's great to hear Lurie is enjoying Lurie's clean teeth challenge and the challenge's helped Lurie cut out some late night snacks, which is a bonus.",0,0,
2465917,We'll check in with Lurie's one final time at the end of this week.,0,0,
2465918,"But now to find out why looking after your teeth and your mouth is so important for your health and your brain, I'm talking to Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry.",0,0,
2465919,Good day.,0,0,
2465920,Good day.,0,0,
2465921,What exactly is gum disease?,0,0,
2465922,gum disease is formed by bacteria in the mouth.,0,0,
2465923,It's like the dental plaque or the bacteria wedge between the gum and the enamel and forms pockets.,0,0,
2465924,Eventually gum disease erodes the soft tissues and even the hard tissues and then the teeth fall out.,0,0,
2465925,"Now obviously gum disease is bad for your mouth, but how does gum disease affect the rest of your body?",0,0,
2465926,So there is this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums.,0,0,
2465927,"Once this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums goes into the bloodstream, this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums can go to different organs all over the body.",0,0,
2465928,"And we do know things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke're all related to periodontal disease or gum disease.",0,0,
2465929,"So things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke can also cross the blood-brain barrier and get into your brain.",0,0,
2465930,"And that is Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's area of research, is that right?",0,0,
2465931,The mouth-brain connection.,0,0,
2465932,Yes.,0,0,
2465933,"So initially we obtained a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and we examined Alzheimer's disease brains and non-Alzheimer's disease brains in the laboratory and looking for signatures of DNA from bacteria in the mouth, as well as any proteins that might be associated with bacteria in the mouth.",0,0,
2465934,And we found signatures of DNA from these bacteria from the gum were exclusively within the Alzheimer's disease brains and not in the non-Alzheimer's control brains.,0,0,
2465935,"So you're looking at a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients, it was only in the Alzheimer's disease's patients that you actually found the presence of these bacteria from the gum?",0,0,
2465936,That's correct.,0,0,
2465937,"That must have been an exciting moment, also slightly disturbing.",0,0,
2465938,"The idea that you can go from the mouth to the brain to dementia is a very big step, isn't it?",0,0,
2465939,Absolutely.,0,0,
2465940,"As soon as we published our first study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, we were constantly being asked, well, can you show us that these bacteria from the gum actually get to the brain?",0,0,
2465941,It's incredible.,0,0,
2465942,So the next study we conducted was in collaboration with the University of Florida.,0,0,
2465943,So what the University of Florida did was the University of Florida caused periodontal disease experimentally in mice and what we found was that bacteria had entered the brains of mice.,0,0,
2465944,Clearly the message is that oral health is unbelievably important for your body and your and what are the best ways of looking after your teeth and your mouth generally?,0,0,
2465945,What are Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's top tips?,0,0,
2465946,Top tips are obviously clean your mouth twice a day at least for two minutes each time.,0,0,
2465947,"First thing in the morning, last thing at night.",0,0,
2465948,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush it,0,0,
2465949,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush fluoride toothpaste and then you can let some of fluoride toothpaste linger on into your teeth and gums so that fluoride toothpaste has the added protection for a little bit longer to act on the teeth.,0,0,
2465950,So I'm told spit but don't rinse.,0,0,
2465951,What about the tongue?,0,0,
2465952,Do you do anything with your tongue?,0,0,
2465953,"Well, our research has actually shown the tongue gets very dirty.",0,0,
2465954,That was a surprise.,0,0,
2465955,"Definitely, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think it's important to clean the tongue.",0,0,
2465956,What do Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think about mouthwashes?,0,0,
2465957,Good or bad?,0,0,
2465958,"Well, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think mouthwashes have mouthwashes's place.",0,0,
2465959,We should really go by when the dentist has recommended mouthwashes's use and for how long.,0,0,
2465960,"Alternatively, if you feel that you want to use a mouthwash then Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry would certainly make sure that you understand the instructions on a mouthwash.",0,0,
2465961,So brush for two minutes including your tongue and just spit.,0,0,
2465962,Don't rinse your mouth afterwards.,0,0,
2465963,Most of us would also benefit from flossing or using interdental brushes before we brush our teeth.,0,0,
2465964,A study of dental students in Iran found that flossing before rather than after removed the most plaque.,0,0,
2465965,Another tip from the British Dental Association is to brush before breakfast and to wait a full hour after your evening meal to brush again.,0,0,
2465966,"And that's because eating creates acid in the mouth, weakening your enamel.",0,0,
2465967,Brushing too soon after a meal can actually damage your teeth.,0,0,
2465968,So there we go.,0,0,
2465969,Let's check in with Lurie one final time.,0,0,
2465970,Let's find out if Lurie has been able to stick to Lurie's new oral hygiene routine.,0,0,
2465971,It's the end of the week and I've actually really enjoyed the task that I was given.,0,0,
2465972,Lurie've really surprised Lurie by how relaxing Lurie found the interdental brushes.,0,0,
2465973,Aesthetically the task that I was given's been brilliant.,0,0,
2465974,Lurie's teeth have never looked this good.,0,0,
2465975,"People have even commented on how white My teeth are, which has never happened before.",0,0,
2465976,"But it's also really good to know that Lurie am doing something that could prevent dementia, could reduce Lurie's chance of getting heart disease.",0,0,
2465977,So it's definitely a win-win and definitely something that Lurie will continue doing as we go forward.,0,0,
2465978,I'm delighted to hear that Lurie will be sticking with Lurie's new routine.,0,0,
2465979,I've also been paying particular attention to my dental hygiene the week.,0,0,
2465980,"I already regularly flossed and brushed my teeth before the task that I was given, but since Lurie started using those plaque disclosing tablets, I've begun to focus on areas where I obviously hadn't been that thorough.",0,0,
2465981,"I do believe that doing this will not only help me keep my teeth for as long as possible, but also offer health benefits beyond my mouth.",0,0,
2465982,"Floss or use an interdental brush, then apply the electric toothbrush and your gums, your heart and your brain will thank you.",0,0,
2465983,So that's it.,0,0,
2465984,"It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",0,0,

2465988,Officials say a case of mass hysteria broke out at a girl's school.,0,0,
2465989,What starts with a case of mass hysteria spreading through a school leads us to consider one of the most profound issues of our time.,0,0,
2465990,Young people are so concerned about the state of the earth and then Young people are labelled as hysterical.,0,0,
2465991,"I'm Matthew Side and in the new season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast, Sideways, I'd like to tell you stories of seeing the world differently and explore the ideas that shape our lives.",0,0,
