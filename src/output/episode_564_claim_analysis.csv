2465497,"Nuts often get a bad press because they are high in fat, and they can cause life-threatening allergies, which is why they are rightly banned from places like schools and nurseries.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2465498,"But if, like me, you're able to eat nuts, this is definitely one thing you should start doing today.",Not Checkworthy,0,4,Not Checkworthy,True
2465499,These are amazing little nutritional powerhouses.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465500,"When we eat them, we get lots of fibre and, importantly, compounds called polyphenols, which feed our gut bacteria and can reduce inflammation.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True

2465504,Let's see if a handful of nuts a day is just one thing she can fit into her diet.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465505,"Hi, Emma.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2465506,"Hi, Mike.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2465507,Confessions time.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2465508,Are you a snacker?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465509,"Yes, I definitely am.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465510,I'm a bit of a chocoholic.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465511,"Anything involving chocolate, even if it's chocolate-covered rice cakes or chocolate buttons.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465512,I can feel my mouth salivating.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465513,I'm a huge fan.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465514,Do you have them in the house?,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465515,"I try and avoid it, but inevitably, if I've got a big deadline, I'll nip off to the shops to get something sweet.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465516,"My eating habits are not as healthy as they should be, and I tend to crash in terms of energy levels quite regularly through the day.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465517,I think I'm relying too much on sugar.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465518,"Okay, so Emma, I'm going to ask you to do a hard thing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465519,I'm going to ask you to put aside your regular snacks and have a small handful of nuts a day.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465520,So it's about 30 grams if you want to weigh them out.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465521,This is a substitute.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465522,This is not in addition.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465523,I'll do my best.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465524,This could be a breakthrough for me.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465525,I've asked Emma to swap her usual sweet treats for a handful of nuts every day for a week.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465526,We'll see if she's cracked it later this week.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465527,"The nutty thing, botanically speaking, is that most of the nuts we like to eat aren't actually nuts, which are defined as a dry fruit with a single seed encased in a hard shell.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465528,"Based on this definition, chestnuts and hazelnuts are true nuts, while almonds and cashews are classified as droops.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465529,They have a fleshy outer layer.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465530,"Whether they are true nuts or droops, they are still packed full of good things like unsaturated fats, fibre and protein, as well as a number of compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are good for you.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465531,"So good, they may even slow the ageing process at the cellular level by preserving our telomeres.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465532,These are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465533,"As we get older, the telomeres gradually shrink.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465534,"Eventually, they get too short to do their job and our cells can't function properly.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465535,"The longer those caps are, the younger your DNA is, and several studies have found a link between eating nuts and retaining the length of these telomeres.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465536,"As well as keeping your telomeres in good shape, eating nuts may reduce your risk of a whole range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465537,"A five-year Spanish intervention study involving over 7,000 older adults found that the group who were asked to eat nuts more than three times a week were over 40% less likely to die from cancer and 55% less likely from heart disease, compared to the control group who didn't.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465538,"And that was after controlling for other lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, physical activity and smoking.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465539,Those are some big numbers and you don't need to go nuts.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465540,A handful a day is plenty.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465541,One thing that puts people off nuts is the fact that some are about 70% fat.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465542,"But it's unsaturated fats, the sort that can actually benefit your heart health.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465543,"A massive study involving more than 300,000 people found that eating more nuts is associated with reduced weight gain over a five-year period, as well as a lower risk of becoming overweight or obese.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465544,And do bear in mind the human brain is about 60% fat.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465545,Our brains need fat to work well.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465546,New research shows that eating nuts can actually give your thinking skills a boost.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465547,How?,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465548,"Well, we'll crack into that with an expert in a moment.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465549,"But first, let's find out how Emma is getting on.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465550,So this is day four of my nut snack adventure.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465551,I'm really enjoying it so far.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465552,I weigh out my nuts in the morning.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465553,"I've been eating them generally at around 11 o'clock, so as a morning snack.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465554,I do find them quite good to munch on.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465555,I have been finding nuts quite satisfying.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465556,"Yeah, so midway through",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465557,and we'll keep going to the end of the week.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465558,It sounds like Emma has found it easy to swap out her sugary treats for nutty snacks.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465559,So I'm keen to see if she sticks with it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465560,"But first, let's choose some nutty fat with Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465561,Hello there.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465562,"Hi, Michael.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465563,How are you?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465564,"Very good, thanks.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465565,"Now, I can understand why nuts are good for my diet, but tell me why they are good for my brain.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465566,They are good for our cognitive function.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465567,So this was based on a study that we published recently in 2021.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465568,We compared the nut intake and cognitive function of over 1800 older adults in America.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465569,"We found that older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day, perform significantly better in terms of their short-term memory, fluency, processing speed, and also attention.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465570,"Right, and 15 to 30 grams, that was enough to produce these changes in their cognitive skills.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465571,Why do you think that nuts are good for the brain?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465572,"In one study, they found that including nuts into the diet can actually improve the brain reactivity.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465573,"They also found that the small blood vessels in the brain actually have higher elasticity, so meaning that there's better blood flow into the brain, potentially explaining the benefits.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465574,And are some types of nuts better than others?,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465575,"In terms of nuts, they all have very similar kind of nutrient profile.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465576,"So they are all high in protein, they are all high in unsaturated fats, which are healthy.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465577,"For example, if we are talking about cardiovascular health, we see the benefits coming from almonds, we see the benefits coming from peanuts, we see the benefits coming from walnuts and other nuts as well.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465578,So there's no reason to believe that one nut is better than another.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465579,"Right, that's interesting because I always thought that peanuts were an almost inferior type of nut.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465580,"Now, one of the ideas that has been around for a long time is that eating nuts is likely to help you put on weight because they're so full of fat and protein, and yet your research suggests that's not the case.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465581,That is correct.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465582,"If we look at the body of research out there, the body of evidence, they all seem to suggest consistently that including nuts into the diet doesn't really have much effect on your body weight.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465583,"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465584,"So many, many studies have repeatedly shown that incorporating nuts into the diet doesn't make you gain weight.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465585,So why might that be?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465586,There are a number of potential explanations for that phenomenon.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465587,We don't absorb all the fat or all the energy from nuts when we consume them.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465588,That's the first reason.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465589,"The second reason is that when we eat nuts, we feel fuller and consequently we adjust our diet in the next meal.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465590,The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465591,Nuts must be one of the tougher foods that modern humans eat.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465592,"So I'm assuming there's something about the structure, which means we don't actually absorb quite as much of the fat that's in the nut while at the same time getting all those benefits that come with the fibre.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465593,"So if we look at the structure of nuts under the microscope, we would see something like boxes.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465594,So imagine if you have thousands of shoe boxes put together and within each box you have fat inside.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465595,"So in order to access the fat in those shoe boxes, we would have to go in and break all the shoe boxes.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465596,"When we chew the nuts, we break the boxes, we release the fat.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465597,"But in the process, not all boxes are being broken.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465598,"Hence, there's still about 20% of fat left in the boxes that are not accessible by the body.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465599,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465600,"Now, I have been using nuts as a snack.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465601,"Rather than reach for a chocolate bar, I tend to eat a small handful of nuts.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465602,"I have tried to go for sort of unsalted, healthy nuts, if you like.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465603,"I have to say, I found salted nuts more addictive.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465604,"So probably the challenge with nuts is stopping, isn't it?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465605,"Small handful, fine.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465606,"Large bowlful, not fine.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465607,That's correct.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465608,"So even though we do see a lot of benefits coming from nuts, we don't recommend people to go nuts about eating nuts.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465609,We do want people to maintain at a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465610,The one thing that I can say on that is that a lot of the beneficial compounds are found on the skin of the nuts.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465611,"So when you prepare your nuts, whether it's in cooking or in baking or consuming them on its own, make sure that you consume the skin of the nuts together with the nuts in order to get all the nutrients, all the beneficial compounds coming from nuts.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465612,So that's the science.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465613,Now let's check in one more time with Emma to see if she's enjoyed her nutty week.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465614,"So it's the end of my nut challenge week and I've really enjoyed it, actually.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465615,"I've had them in the morning with some yogurt, which was lovely.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465616,I think it did help regulate my mealtimes a bit better.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465617,I've definitely found I'm eating less chocolate.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465618,I think my energy levels have improved.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465619,"I'm not crushing so much during the day, which is great.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465620,"So yes, I'm going to try and continue.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465621,I am pleased to hear that Emma has gone nuts for nuts.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465622,"And as promised, I've been doing the challenge all week too.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465623,"I have been snacking on nuts quite a bit, as well as incorporating more nuts into my meals.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465624,So today I'm making an apple hazelnut salad.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465625,"As you can hear, I've been slicing the apples and I've got a packet of hazelnuts here.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465626,I'm just going to sort of scatter them around a bit and grab a few as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465627,Nibbling on nuts has really given me a boost.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465628,It's also helped me stay away from those mid-afternoon biscuits.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465629,I am definitely going to be sticking to a nuttier diet.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465630,So why don't you give it a go as well?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465631,"Your brain, heart and even your waistline might thank you for it.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465632,So that's it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465633,"It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465634,"On the next episode of Just One Thing, cook with turmeric.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465638,"We start in a galaxy far, far away and a long time ago.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465639,So it's Australia.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465640,"Oh, OK.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465641,Australia then.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465642,"We start, it felt like a galaxy to me, but we were in Australia where we talked about, well, spiders.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465643,You were scared of spiders.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465644,"I wasn't actually scared, but you'll hear many trailers for this thing where they say, I wasn't scared of spiders.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465645,"We also did astronomy actually in Australia, which is fantastic.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465646,"And then we came back to the UK and we had guests like Ross Noble, Susan Calliman, Russell Kane, Ed Byrne, Joe Brand, Sally Gunnell.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465647,"Yeah, Anna Fry, Sue Black, Randa Munro.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465648,"And we found out, amongst other things, how to commit the perfect murder, which still hasn't really worked for me because I'm still so upset at him.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
