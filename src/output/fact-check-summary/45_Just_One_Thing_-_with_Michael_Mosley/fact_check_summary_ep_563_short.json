        "The authors suggest that it's the curcumin, which is a polyphenol in the turmeric, which is responsible for these positive effects.",
        "The best way to do it is to combine the turmeric with some pepper because piperine seems to increase the bioavailability that means the increased absorption of curcumin in the body.",

        "In a recent Japanese study where overweight but otherwise healthy participants were randomly allocated to placebo or curcumin extract, they found those taking curcumin extract had lower levels of an inflammatory marker in the blood called C-reactive protein.",
        "So compared to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen, there seems to be no adverse event for turmeric extract.",
        "That means Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen cannot be taken in older patients."
