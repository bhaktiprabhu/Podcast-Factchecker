2465509,"Yes, Mike definitely am.",0,0,
2465510,Mike'm a bit of a chocoholic.,0,0,
2465511,"Anything involving chocolate, even if Anything involving chocolate's chocolate-covered rice cakes or chocolate buttons.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465512,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey can feel Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's mouth salivating.",0,0,
2465513,I'm a huge fan.,0,0,
2465514,"Do Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey have chocolate-covered rice cakes or chocolate buttons in the house?",1,0,Checkworthy
2465515,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey try and avoid it, but inevitably, if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey've got a big deadline, Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey'll nip off to the shops to get something sweet.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465516,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's eating habits are not as healthy as My eating habits should be, and Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey tend to crash in terms of energy levels quite regularly through the day.",0,0,
2465517,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey think Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey'm relying too much on sugar.",0,0,
2465518,"Okay, so Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey, Mike'm going to ask Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey to do a hard thing.",0,0,
2465519,"Mike'm going to ask Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey to put aside Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's regular snacks and have a small handful of nuts a day.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465520,"So a small handful of nuts a day's about 30 grams if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey want to weigh them out.",0,0,
2465521,a small handful of nuts a day is a substitute.,0,0,
2465522,a small handful of nuts a day is not in addition.,0,0,
2465523,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey'll do Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's best.",0,0,
2465524,"This could be a breakthrough for Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey.",0,0,
2465525,"Mike've asked Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey to swap Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's usual sweet treats for a handful of nuts every day for a week.",0,0,
2465526,"We'll see if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's cracked it later this week.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465527,"The nutty thing, botanically speaking, is that most of the nuts we like to eat aren't actually nuts, which are defined as a dry fruit with a single seed encased in a hard shell.",1,0,Checkworthy
2465528,"Based on this definition, chestnuts and hazelnuts are true nuts, while almonds and cashews are classified as droops.",0,0,
2465529,almonds and cashews have a fleshy outer layer.,0,0,
2465530,"Whether almonds and cashews are true nuts or droops, almonds and cashews are still packed full of good things like unsaturated fats, fibre and protein, as well as a number of compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are good for you.",0,0,
2465531,"So good, almonds and cashews may even slow the ageing process at the cellular level by preserving our telomeres.",0,0,
2465532,our telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes.,0,0,
2465533,"As we get older, our telomeres gradually shrink.",0,0,
2465534,"Eventually, the telomeres get too short to do the telomeres's job and our cells can't function properly.",0,0,
2465535,"The longer our telomeres are, the younger your DNA is, and several studies have found a link between eating nuts and retaining the length of our telomeres.",0,0,
2465536,"As well as keeping your telomeres in good shape, eating nuts may reduce your risk of a whole range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease.",0,0,
2465537,"A five-year Spanish intervention study involving over 7,000 older adults found that the group who were asked to eat nuts more than three times a week were over 40% less likely to die from cancer and 55% less likely from heart disease, compared to the control group who didn't.",0,0,
2465538,"And that was after controlling for other lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, physical activity and smoking.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465539,Those are some big numbers and you don't need to go nuts.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465540,A handful a day is plenty.,0,0,
2465541,One thing that puts people off nuts is the fact that some are about 70% fat.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465542,"But it's unsaturated fats, the sort that can actually benefit your heart health.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465543,"A massive study involving more than 300,000 people found that eating more nuts is associated with reduced weight gain over a five-year period, as well as a lower risk of becoming overweight or obese.",0,0,
2465544,And do bear in mind the human brain is about 60% fat.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465545,Our brains need fat to work well.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465546,New research shows that eating nuts can actually give your thinking skills a boost.,0,0,
2465547,How?,1,0,Checkworthy
2465548,"Well, we'll crack into that with an expert in a moment.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465549,"But first, let's find out how Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey is getting on.",0,0,
2465550,So this is day four of Mike's nut snack adventure.,0,0,
2465551,Mike'm really enjoying my nut snack adventure so far.,0,0,
2465552,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey weigh out Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's nuts in the morning.",0,0,
2465553,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey've been eating my nuts generally at around 11 o'clock, so as a morning snack.",0,0,
2465554,Emma do find my nuts quite good to munch on.,0,0,
2465555,Emma have been finding nuts quite satisfying.,0,0,
2465556,"Yeah, so midway through",0,0,
2465557,"Yeah, so midway through and we'll keep going to the end of the week.",0,0,
2465558,It sounds like Emma has found it easy to swap out Emma's sugary treats for nutty snacks.,0,0,
2465559,So Emma'm keen to see if Emma sticks with it.,0,0,
2465560,"But first, let's choose some nutty fat with an expert.",0,0,
2465561,Hello there.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465562,"Hi, Michael.",0,0,
2465563,How are Michael?,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465564,"Very good, thanks.",0,0,
2465565,"Now, Michael can understand why nuts are good for Michael's diet, but tell Michael why nuts are good for Michael's brain.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465566,nuts are good for our cognitive function.,0,0,
2465567,So this was based on a study that we published recently in 2021.,0,0,
2465568,We compared the nut intake and cognitive function of over 1800 older adults in America.,0,0,
2465569,"We found that older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day, perform significantly better in terms of older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's short-term memory, fluency, processing speed, and also attention.",0,0,
2465570,"Right, and 15 to 30 grams, 15 to 30 grams was enough to produce these changes in older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's cognitive skills.",0,0,
2465571,Why do an expert think that nuts are good for the brain?,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465572,"In one study, they found that including nuts into the diet can actually improve the brain reactivity.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465573,"They also found that the small blood vessels in the brain actually have higher elasticity, so meaning that there's better blood flow into the brain, potentially explaining the benefits.",0,0,
2465574,And are some types of nuts better than others?,1,0,Checkworthy
2465575,"In terms of nuts, they all have very similar kind of nutrient profile.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465576,"So they are all high in protein, they are all high in unsaturated fats, which are healthy.",0,0,
2465577,"For example, if we are talking about cardiovascular health, we see the benefits coming from almonds, we see the benefits coming from peanuts, we see the benefits coming from walnuts and other nuts as well.",0,0,
2465578,So there's no reason to believe that one nut is better than another.,0,0,
2465579,"Right, that's interesting because Michael always thought that peanuts were an almost inferior type of nut.",0,0,
2465580,"Now, one of the ideas that has been around for a long time is that eating nuts is likely to help you put on weight because nuts're so full of fat and protein, and yet Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia's research suggests that's not the case.",0,0,
2465581,That is correct.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465582,"If we look at the body of research out there, the body of evidence, they the body of research out there, the body of evidence seem to suggest consistently that including nuts into the diet doesn't really have much effect on your body weight.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465583,"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.",0,0,
2465584,"So many, many studies have repeatedly shown that incorporating nuts into the diet doesn't make you gain weight.",0,0,
2465585,So why might that be?,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465586,There are a number of potential explanations for that phenomenon.,0,0,
2465587,We don't absorb all the fat or all the energy from nuts when we consume nuts.,0,0,
2465588,That's the first reason.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465589,"The second reason is that when we eat nuts, we feel fuller and consequently we adjust our diet in the next meal.",0,0,
2465590,The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,0,0,
2465591,Nuts must be one of the tougher foods that modern humans eat.,0,0,
2465592,"So Michael'm assuming there's something about the structure, which means we don't actually absorb quite as much of the fat that's in the nut while at the same time getting all those benefits that come with the fibre.",0,0,
2465593,"So if we look at the structure of nuts under the microscope, we would see something like boxes.",0,0,
2465594,So imagine if you have thousands of shoe boxes put together and within each box you have fat inside.,0,0,
2465595,"So in order to access the fat in thousands of shoe boxes put together, we would have to go in and break thousands of shoe boxes put together.",0,0,
2465596,"When we chew the nuts, we break thousands of shoe boxes put together, we release the fat in those shoe boxes.",0,0,
2465597,"But in the process, not all boxes are being broken.",0,0,
2465598,"Hence, there's still about 20% of fat left in thousands of shoe boxes put together that are not accessible by the body.",1,0,Checkworthy
2465599,Right.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465600,"Now, Michael have been using nuts as a snack.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465601,"Rather than reach for a chocolate bar, Michael tend to eat a small handful of nuts.",0,0,
2465602,"Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia have tried to go for sort of unsalted, healthy nuts, if you like.",0,0,
2465603,"Michael have to say, Michael found salted nuts more addictive.",0,0,
2465604,"So probably the challenge with nuts is stopping, isn't the challenge with nuts?",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465605,"Small handful, fine.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465606,"Large bowlful, not fine.",0,0,
2465607,That's correct.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465608,"So even though we do see a lot of benefits coming from nuts, we don't recommend people to go nuts about eating nuts.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465609,We do want people to maintain at a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day.,0,0,
2465610,The one thing that Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia can say on a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day is that a lot of the beneficial compounds are found on the skin of the nuts.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465611,"So when you prepare your nuts, whether it's in cooking or in baking or consuming your nuts on its own, make sure that you consume the skin of the nuts together with the nuts in order to get all the nutrients, all the beneficial compounds coming from nuts.",0,0,
2465612,So that's the science.,0,0,
2465613,Now let's check in one more time with Emma to see if Emma's enjoyed Emma's nutty week.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465614,"So it's the end of Emma's nut challenge week and Emma've really enjoyed her nutty week, actually.",0,0,
2465615,"Emma've had them in the morning with some yogurt, which was lovely.",0,0,
2465616,Emma think it did help regulate Emma's mealtimes a bit better.,0,0,
2465617,Emma've definitely found Emma'm eating less chocolate.,0,0,
2465618,Emma think Emma's energy levels have improved.,0,0,
2465619,"Emma'm not crushing so much during the day, which is great.",0,0,
2465620,"So yes, Emma'm going to try and continue.",0,0,
2465621,I am pleased to hear that Emma has gone nuts for nuts.,0,0,
2465622,"And as promised, I've been doing the challenge all week too.",0,0,
2465623,"I have been snacking on nuts quite a bit, as well as incorporating more nuts into my meals.",0,0,
2465624,So today I'm making an apple hazelnut salad.,0,0,
2465625,"As you can hear, I've been slicing the apples and I've got a packet of hazelnuts here.",0,0,
2465626,I'm just going to sort of scatter a packet of hazelnuts around a bit and grab a few as well.,0,0,
2465627,Nibbling on nuts has really given me a boost.,0,0,
2465628,It's also helped Emma stay away from those mid-afternoon biscuits.,0,0,
2465629,I am definitely going to be sticking to a nuttier diet.,0,0,
2465630,So why don't you give a nuttier diet a go as well?,0,0,
2465631,"Your brain, heart and even your waistline might thank you for a nuttier diet.",0,0,
2465632,So that's it.,0,0,
2465633,"a nuttier diet's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",0,0,
2465634,"On the next episode of Just One Thing, cook with turmeric.",0,0,

2465638,"We start in a galaxy far, far away and a long time ago.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465639,So it's Australia.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465640,"Oh, OK.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465641,Australia then.,1,0,Checkworthy
2465642,"We start, it felt like a galaxy to me, but we were in Australia where we talked about, well, spiders.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465643,You were scared of spiders.,0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465644,"Robin wasn't actually scared, but you'll hear many trailers for this thing where they say, I wasn't scared of spiders.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465645,"We also did astronomy actually in Australia, which is fantastic.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465646,"And then we came back to the UK and we had guests like Ross Noble, Susan Calliman, Russell Kane, Ed Byrne, Joe Brand, Sally Gunnell.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465647,"Yeah, Anna Fry, Sue Black, Randa Munro.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
2465648,"And we found out, amongst other things, how to commit the perfect murder, which still hasn't really worked for Emma because Emma'm still so upset at him.",0,1,Not Checkworthy
