2465519,"Mike'm going to ask Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey to put aside Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's regular snacks and have a small handful of nuts a day.",FALSE,False
2465520,"So a small handful of nuts a day's about 30 grams if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey want to weigh them out.",FALSE,False
2465521,a small handful of nuts a day is a substitute.,FALSE,False
2465522,a small handful of nuts a day is not in addition.,FALSE,False
2465523,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey'll do Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's best.",FALSE,False

2465526,"We'll see if Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's cracked it later this week.",FALSE,False
2465527,"The nutty thing, botanically speaking, is that most of the nuts we like to eat aren't actually nuts, which are defined as a dry fruit with a single seed encased in a hard shell.",FALSE,True
2465528,"Based on this definition, chestnuts and hazelnuts are true nuts, while almonds and cashews are classified as droops.",TRUE,True
2465529,almonds and cashews have a fleshy outer layer.,FALSE,True
2465530,"Whether almonds and cashews are true nuts or droops, almonds and cashews are still packed full of good things like unsaturated fats, fibre and protein, as well as a number of compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are good for you.",FALSE,False
2465531,"So good, almonds and cashews may even slow the ageing process at the cellular level by preserving our telomeres.",FALSE,True
2465532,our telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes.,FALSE,True
2465533,"As we get older, our telomeres gradually shrink.",FALSE,True

2465537,"A five-year Spanish intervention study involving over 7,000 older adults found that the group who were asked to eat nuts more than three times a week were over 40% less likely to die from cancer and 55% less likely from heart disease, compared to the control group who didn't.",TRUE,True
2465538,"And that was after controlling for other lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, physical activity and smoking.",FALSE,False
2465539,Those are some big numbers and you don't need to go nuts.,FALSE,False

2465545,Our brains need fat to work well.,FALSE,True

2465547,How?,FALSE,False
2465548,"Well, we'll crack into that with an expert in a moment.",FALSE,False
2465549,"But first, let's find out how Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey is getting on.",FALSE,False
2465550,So this is day four of Mike's nut snack adventure.,FALSE,False
2465551,Mike'm really enjoying my nut snack adventure so far.,FALSE,False
2465552,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey weigh out Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey's nuts in the morning.",FALSE,False
2465553,"Emma, who is a journalist from Surrey've been eating my nuts generally at around 11 o'clock, so as a morning snack.",FALSE,False
2465554,Emma do find my nuts quite good to munch on.,FALSE,False
2465555,Emma have been finding nuts quite satisfying.,FALSE,False
2465556,"Yeah, so midway through",FALSE,False
2465557,"Yeah, so midway through and we'll keep going to the end of the week.",FALSE,False
2465558,It sounds like Emma has found it easy to swap out Emma's sugary treats for nutty snacks.,FALSE,False
2465559,So Emma'm keen to see if Emma sticks with it.,FALSE,False
2465560,"But first, let's choose some nutty fat with an expert.",FALSE,False
2465561,Hello there.,FALSE,False
2465562,"Hi, Michael.",FALSE,False
2465563,How are Michael?,FALSE,False
2465564,"Very good, thanks.",FALSE,False
2465565,"Now, Michael can understand why nuts are good for Michael's diet, but tell Michael why nuts are good for Michael's brain.",FALSE,False
2465566,nuts are good for our cognitive function.,FALSE,True
2465567,So this was based on a study that we published recently in 2021.,TRUE,True
2465568,We compared the nut intake and cognitive function of over 1800 older adults in America.,TRUE,False
2465569,"We found that older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day, perform significantly better in terms of older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's short-term memory, fluency, processing speed, and also attention.",TRUE,True
2465570,"Right, and 15 to 30 grams, 15 to 30 grams was enough to produce these changes in older adults who consume nuts, about 15 to 30 grams per day's cognitive skills.",TRUE,True
2465571,Why do an expert think that nuts are good for the brain?,FALSE,False
2465572,"In one study, they found that including nuts into the diet can actually improve the brain reactivity.",TRUE,True
2465573,"They also found that the small blood vessels in the brain actually have higher elasticity, so meaning that there's better blood flow into the brain, potentially explaining the benefits.",TRUE,True
2465574,And are some types of nuts better than others?,FALSE,False
2465575,"In terms of nuts, they all have very similar kind of nutrient profile.",TRUE,True
2465576,"So they are all high in protein, they are all high in unsaturated fats, which are healthy.",TRUE,False
2465577,"For example, if we are talking about cardiovascular health, we see the benefits coming from almonds, we see the benefits coming from peanuts, we see the benefits coming from walnuts and other nuts as well.",FALSE,False
2465578,So there's no reason to believe that one nut is better than another.,FALSE,False
2465579,"Right, that's interesting because Michael always thought that peanuts were an almost inferior type of nut.",FALSE,False
2465580,"Now, one of the ideas that has been around for a long time is that eating nuts is likely to help you put on weight because nuts're so full of fat and protein, and yet Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia's research suggests that's not the case.",TRUE,True
2465581,That is correct.,FALSE,False
2465582,"If we look at the body of research out there, the body of evidence, they the body of research out there, the body of evidence seem to suggest consistently that including nuts into the diet doesn't really have much effect on your body weight.",TRUE,True
2465583,"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.",TRUE,True
2465584,"So many, many studies have repeatedly shown that incorporating nuts into the diet doesn't make you gain weight.",TRUE,True
2465585,So why might that be?,FALSE,False
2465586,There are a number of potential explanations for that phenomenon.,FALSE,False
2465587,We don't absorb all the fat or all the energy from nuts when we consume nuts.,FALSE,True
2465588,That's the first reason.,FALSE,False
2465589,"The second reason is that when we eat nuts, we feel fuller and consequently we adjust our diet in the next meal.",FALSE,True
2465590,The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,TRUE,True
2465591,Nuts must be one of the tougher foods that modern humans eat.,FALSE,False
2465592,"So Michael'm assuming there's something about the structure, which means we don't actually absorb quite as much of the fat that's in the nut while at the same time getting all those benefits that come with the fibre.",FALSE,False
2465593,"So if we look at the structure of nuts under the microscope, we would see something like boxes.",FALSE,True
2465594,So imagine if you have thousands of shoe boxes put together and within each box you have fat inside.,FALSE,False
2465595,"So in order to access the fat in thousands of shoe boxes put together, we would have to go in and break thousands of shoe boxes put together.",FALSE,False
2465596,"When we chew the nuts, we break thousands of shoe boxes put together, we release the fat in those shoe boxes.",FALSE,False
2465597,"But in the process, not all boxes are being broken.",FALSE,False
2465598,"Hence, there's still about 20% of fat left in thousands of shoe boxes put together that are not accessible by the body.",TRUE,False
2465599,Right.,FALSE,False
2465600,"Now, Michael have been using nuts as a snack.",FALSE,False
2465601,"Rather than reach for a chocolate bar, Michael tend to eat a small handful of nuts.",FALSE,False
2465602,"Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia have tried to go for sort of unsalted, healthy nuts, if you like.",TRUE,True
2465603,"Michael have to say, Michael found salted nuts more addictive.",FALSE,False
2465604,"So probably the challenge with nuts is stopping, isn't the challenge with nuts?",FALSE,False
2465605,"Small handful, fine.",FALSE,False
2465606,"Large bowlful, not fine.",FALSE,False
2465607,That's correct.,FALSE,False
2465608,"So even though we do see a lot of benefits coming from nuts, we don't recommend people to go nuts about eating nuts.",FALSE,False
2465609,We do want people to maintain at a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day.,FALSE,False
2465610,The one thing that Dr Ziyan Tan from the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University in Australia can say on a level of about 15 to 30 grams per day is that a lot of the beneficial compounds are found on the skin of the nuts.,TRUE,True
2465611,"So when you prepare your nuts, whether it's in cooking or in baking or consuming your nuts on its own, make sure that you consume the skin of the nuts together with the nuts in order to get all the nutrients, all the beneficial compounds coming from nuts.",FALSE,True
2465612,So that's the science.,FALSE,False
2465613,Now let's check in one more time with Emma to see if Emma's enjoyed Emma's nutty week.,FALSE,False
2465614,"So it's the end of Emma's nut challenge week and Emma've really enjoyed her nutty week, actually.",FALSE,False
2465615,"Emma've had them in the morning with some yogurt, which was lovely.",FALSE,False
2465616,Emma think it did help regulate Emma's mealtimes a bit better.,FALSE,False
2465617,Emma've definitely found Emma'm eating less chocolate.,FALSE,False
2465618,Emma think Emma's energy levels have improved.,FALSE,False
2465619,"Emma'm not crushing so much during the day, which is great.",FALSE,False
2465620,"So yes, Emma'm going to try and continue.",FALSE,False
2465621,I am pleased to hear that Emma has gone nuts for nuts.,FALSE,False
2465622,"And as promised, I've been doing the challenge all week too.",FALSE,False
2465623,"I have been snacking on nuts quite a bit, as well as incorporating more nuts into my meals.",FALSE,False
2465624,So today I'm making an apple hazelnut salad.,FALSE,False
2465625,"As you can hear, I've been slicing the apples and I've got a packet of hazelnuts here.",FALSE,False
2465626,I'm just going to sort of scatter a packet of hazelnuts around a bit and grab a few as well.,FALSE,False
2465627,Nibbling on nuts has really given me a boost.,FALSE,False
2465628,It's also helped Emma stay away from those mid-afternoon biscuits.,FALSE,False
2465629,I am definitely going to be sticking to a nuttier diet.,FALSE,False
2465630,So why don't you give a nuttier diet a go as well?,FALSE,False
2465631,"Your brain, heart and even your waistline might thank you for a nuttier diet.",FALSE,True
2465632,So that's it.,FALSE,False
2465633,"a nuttier diet's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",FALSE,False
2465634,"On the next episode of Just One Thing, cook with turmeric.",FALSE,False

2465638,"We start in a galaxy far, far away and a long time ago.",FALSE,False
2465639,So it's Australia.,FALSE,False
2465640,"Oh, OK.",FALSE,False
2465641,Australia then.,FALSE,False
2465642,"We start, it felt like a galaxy to me, but we were in Australia where we talked about, well, spiders.",FALSE,False
2465643,You were scared of spiders.,FALSE,False
2465644,"Robin wasn't actually scared, but you'll hear many trailers for this thing where they say, I wasn't scared of spiders.",FALSE,False
2465645,"We also did astronomy actually in Australia, which is fantastic.",FALSE,False
2465646,"And then we came back to the UK and we had guests like Ross Noble, Susan Calliman, Russell Kane, Ed Byrne, Joe Brand, Sally Gunnell.",FALSE,True
2465647,"Yeah, Anna Fry, Sue Black, Randa Munro.",FALSE,False
