### Supported Claims

1. Allergies is an immune system problem.
2. And mom's's immune system is what's going to help sustain that babies borrow off of mom's immune system from mom's.
3. I mean, Hippocrates says all disease begins in the gut.
4. If your gut health is not intact, if your gut health is not resilient and strong, you are going to suffer in so many downstream ways.
5. Now IgE, IgE are antibodies produced by your immune system.
6. There's so many purposes for animals beyond just animals's companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too.
7. Toxins can change the microbiome.

### Refuted Claims

1. Allergies's a dysregulation of our immune system.
2. And our indoor living environment has been proved to be far more toxic, including the air that we're breathing, right?
3. It can be very therapeutic to even touch an animal.
4. Now we know that the birth canal offers just this coating and bathing of microbes for the baby when the baby're born vaginally.
5. So despite rapid microbial colonization of the gut after birth, environmental microbes in the early postnatal period represent a critical exposure for early life immune programming.
6. So it's so critical in those first few months of life that infants get flooded with these good bacteria, these good microbes to help build some resiliency because infants's immune system depends on it.
7. So microbial composition in infants is actually very low in terms of diversity.
8. a couple of studies did a pooled analysis of about 7,000 households that documented dog ownership during the first two years of life and found that there was reduced sensitization to allergens in early childhood.
