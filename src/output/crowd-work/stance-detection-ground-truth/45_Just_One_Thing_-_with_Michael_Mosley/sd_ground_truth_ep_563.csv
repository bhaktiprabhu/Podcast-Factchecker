"The authors suggest that it's the curcumin, which is a polyphenol in the turmeric, which is responsible for these positive effects.","Turmeric, a spice that has long been recognized for its medicinal properties, has received interest from both the medical/scientific world and from culinary enthusiasts, as it is the major source of the polyphenol curcumin. It aids in the management of oxidative and inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, and hyperlipidemia. It may also help in the management of exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness, thus enhancing recovery and performance in active people. In addition, a relatively low dose of the complex can provide health benefits for people that do not have diagnosed health conditions. Most of these benefits can be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Keywords: curcumin, turmeric, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, polyphenol · Turmeric is a spice that has received much interest from both the medical/scientific worlds as well as from the culinary world. Turmeric is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant (Curcuma longa) of the ginger family [1]. The medicinal properties of turmeric, the source of curcumin, have been known for thousands of years; however, the ability to determine the exact mechanism(s) of action and to determine the bioactive components have only recently been investigated [2]. Curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), also called diferuloylmethane, is the main natural polyphenol found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric) and in others Curcuma spp. Regardless of the mechanism by which curcumin elicits its effects, it does appear to be beneficial to several aspects of OA, as suggested by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that concluded: “This systematic review and meta-analysis provided scientific evidence that 8–12 weeks of standardized turmeric extracts (typically 1000 mg/day of curcumin) treatment can reduce arthritis symptoms (mainly pain and inflammation-related symptoms) and result in similar improvements in the symptoms as ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/,SUPPORTS

When turmeric is eaten with a source of fat, the curcuminoids attach to the fats. This makes them more easily absorbed by the gut. For this reason, consuming curcumin with a fatty meal can significantly enhance turmeric absorption. The bottom line? Turmeric, plus black pepper, plus fat is the best way to increase turmeric absorption and reap the full benefits of this golden super spice!

Curcumin is fat soluble, and therefore consuming curcumin with a fatty meal enhances absorption. Early approaches to enhancing absorption were the addition of turmeric oil (BCM-95®; BioCurcumax®; Curcugreen™) [17,18,19,20], a small amount of piperine (Curcumin C3 Complex®) [21,22,23] to stimulate the gastrointestinal system and prevent efflux of curcumin, or as a turmeric oleoresin (Curcugen™) which have resulted in small incremental increases in curcumin absorption. In this review, formulated curcumin products that provide >100-fold better absorption than unformulated curcumin are considered highly bioavailable. The various formulations designed to enhance curcumin bioavailability can be divided broadly into a number of approaches with specific examples given. Curcumin is fat soluble, and therefore consuming curcumin with a fatty meal enhances absorption. However, its poor solubility and poor absorption in the free form in the gastrointestinal tract and its rapid biotransformation to inactive metabolites greatly limit its utility as a health-promoting agent and dietary supplement.

On the other hand, ibuprofen (Advil) can treat pain in children while naproxen (Aleve) is not approved for use in children under age 12. Naproxen (Aleve) is stronger than ibuprofen (Advil).

That means Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen cannot be taken in older patients.,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently used agents to treat musculoskeletal disorders (principally by the elderly), thus raising the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This work aims to monitor NSAIDs safety profile in older people by using literature and pharmacovigilance data. Published clinical studies reporting the NSAIDs safety in elderly patients (age ≥ 65) were identified by a literature search and were then deeply analyzed. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a wide range of rheumatic conditions and other musculoskeletal disorders is increasing. This is in part due to the growing number of elderly patients who constitute the main users of these drugs [1,2]. Despite their relevant efficacy, NSAIDs must be used with caution in older people due to the high risk of potentially serious and life-threatening adverse effects [1]. NSAIDs constitute a group of therapeutic agents with diverse structural and pharmacological profiles but a similar mechanism of action. A bibliographic search was performed in different databases (Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, Medline and Cochrane Collection Plus) to identify studies addressing the safety of NSAIDs in older patients (age ≥ 65).
