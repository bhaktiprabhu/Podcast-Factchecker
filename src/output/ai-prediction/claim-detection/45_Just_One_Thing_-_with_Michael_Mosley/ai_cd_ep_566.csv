2465846,"And as you probably guessed, I've just been brushing my teeth.",FALSE,FALSE
2465847,Now doing this twice a day after using an interdental brush or some floss to remove the bits of debris between my teeth should benefit my overall health in some surprising ways.,FALSE,FALSE
2465848,"And to see just how good a job I've done, I'm going to chew on a plaque-disclosing tablet.",FALSE,FALSE
2465849,Now here a plaque-disclosing tablet is and here you go.,FALSE,FALSE

2465856,"Here in the UK, a quarter of all adults don't brush a quarter of all adults's teeth twice a day.",TRUE,TRUE

2465858,"Good dental hygiene has some obvious advantages, such as preventing cavities.",FALSE,TRUE
2465859,"But beyond teeth, studies have shown that brushing and using interdental brushes on those tricky to reach bits may reduce your risk of stroke, stave off dementia and benefit your overall health.",TRUE,TRUE

2465861,I'm speaking to Laurie from North Wales.,TRUE,FALSE
2465862,Let's see if improving Laurie from North Wales's dental hygiene is just one thing Laurie from North Wales'd like to focus on.,FALSE,FALSE
2465863,"Hello, Laurie from North Wales.",FALSE,FALSE
2465864,Hi.,FALSE,FALSE
2465865,Do Laurie from North Wales have good teeth or is a like mine full of fillings?,FALSE,FALSE
2465866,Full of fillings.,FALSE,FALSE
2465867,"They're not too bad, but yeah, there's definitely a few issues with them.",FALSE,FALSE
2465868,OK.,FALSE,FALSE
2465869,So tell mine about Laurie from North Wales's tooth brushing technique.,FALSE,FALSE
2465870,"Try and hit all areas, Laurie from North Wales think.",FALSE,FALSE
2465871,"Laurie from North Wales do it twice a day, do Laurie from North Wales?",TRUE,FALSE
2465872,Not every day.,FALSE,FALSE

2465876,No. What about late night snacks?,FALSE,FALSE
2465877,"Yes, Laurie from North Wales definitely do like a late night snack.",FALSE,FALSE
2465878,So do Laurie from North Wales make sure to brush Laurie from North Wales's teeth before Laurie from North Wales go to bed?,FALSE,FALSE
2465879,After Laurie from North Wales've had Laurie from North Wales's late night snack?,FALSE,FALSE
2465880,Not every time.,FALSE,FALSE
2465881,No.,FALSE,FALSE
2465882,No. mine are very honest.,FALSE,FALSE
2465883,Laurie from North Wales like that.,TRUE,FALSE
2465884,So mine have a simple but important challenge for Laurie from North Wales this week.,FALSE,FALSE
2465885,I want Laurie from North Wales to brush Laurie from North Wales's teeth twice a day for two minutes.,FALSE,FALSE
2465886,Do it once when Laurie from North Wales wake and once before bed after that snack.,TRUE,FALSE
2465887,"And do make sure Laurie from North Wales use the interdental brush at least once a day, preferably in the evening.",FALSE,FALSE
2465888,It won't take much of Laurie from North Wales's time.,FALSE,FALSE
2465889,Do Laurie from North Wales think Laurie from North Wales can manage that?,FALSE,FALSE
2465890,Definitely.,FALSE,FALSE
2465891,"Yeah, Laurie from North Wales can definitely do that.",TRUE,FALSE
2465892,mine've asked Laurie from North Wales to focus on Laurie from North Wales's pearly white smile this week because preventing the buildup of bacteria in your gums can have big long-term benefits.,FALSE,FALSE
2465893,"Although some bacteria in your mouth are helpful, the ones that cause gum disease can affect your whole body, causing damage in organs far away from your mouth.",FALSE,TRUE
2465894,"For example, keeping your gums in good shape can benefit your heart.",FALSE,TRUE
2465895,"According to a huge study conducted on over 10,000 men and women from the Scottish Health Survey, people who brush people who brush their teeth twice a day's teeth twice a day have lower rates of heart disease than those who brush once a day or less.",TRUE,TRUE
2465896,Why?,FALSE,FALSE
2465897,"Well, one suggestion is that when bacteria from your mouth leak into your blood, leak activates an immune response.",FALSE,TRUE
2465898,"In the short term, that can be helpful.",FALSE,FALSE
2465899,"But if it continues, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which damages the heart.",FALSE,TRUE
2465900,"These bacteria can also damage the inner lining of your blood vessels, increasing fatty buildup, which in turn can affect blood flow to your vital organs.",FALSE,TRUE
2465901,Good oral hygiene could also help your body in your body's battle against diseases like COVID.,FALSE,TRUE
2465902,"An Egyptian study, which looked at over 300 patients who had recovered from COVID, found that people with healthy gums were less likely to be severely affected.",TRUE,TRUE
2465903,"Another study found that COVID patients with gum disease were over three times as likely to be admitted to intensive care, and COVID patients with gum disease were nine times as likely to die from COVID.",TRUE,TRUE
2465904,Another really good reason for keeping your teeth and gums in good shape is doing so may also protect your brain.,FALSE,TRUE
2465905,A recent study of stroke patients revealed that over 80% had blood clots that showed the presence of oral bacteria.,TRUE,TRUE
2465906,"And another study showed that people who have severe periodontal disease, that's inflamed gums, are also at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease.",TRUE,TRUE
2465907,mine'll be speaking to a scientist about this surprising mouth-brain connection in a moment.,FALSE,FALSE
2465908,"But first, let's check in with Laurie from North Wales to see how Laurie from North Wales's getting on with the challenge.",FALSE,FALSE
2465909,"So Laurie from North Wales'm about halfway through the week and Laurie from North Wales's teeth look amazing, the best my teeth've looked in a long time.",TRUE,FALSE
2465910,Laurie from North Wales'm enjoying doing it in the evenings.,TRUE,FALSE
2465911,It feels like self-care.,FALSE,FALSE
2465912,It's quite nice to take that time out and sit there and use the interdental brushes.,FALSE,FALSE
2465913,"Lori've stuck to cleaning Lori's teeth twice a day, every single day.",TRUE,FALSE
2465914,"It's actually helped Lori with the snacking, because obviously once Lori've done Lori's teeth, Lori then end up not snacking in the evening, so that's been great.",TRUE,FALSE
2465915,"So yeah, really enjoying the challenge and really pleased with how the challenge's going.",FALSE,FALSE
2465916,"It's great to hear Lurie is enjoying Lurie's clean teeth challenge and the challenge's helped Lurie cut out some late night snacks, which is a bonus.",FALSE,FALSE
2465917,We'll check in with Lurie's one final time at the end of this week.,FALSE,FALSE
2465918,"But now to find out why looking after your teeth and your mouth is so important for your health and your brain, I'm talking to Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry.",FALSE,FALSE
2465919,Good day.,FALSE,FALSE
2465920,Good day.,FALSE,FALSE
2465921,What exactly is gum disease?,FALSE,FALSE
2465922,gum disease is formed by bacteria in the mouth.,FALSE,TRUE
2465923,It's like the dental plaque or the bacteria wedge between the gum and the enamel and forms pockets.,FALSE,TRUE
2465924,Eventually gum disease erodes the soft tissues and even the hard tissues and then the teeth fall out.,FALSE,TRUE
2465925,"Now obviously gum disease is bad for your mouth, but how does gum disease affect the rest of your body?",FALSE,FALSE
2465926,So there is this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums.,FALSE,TRUE
2465927,"Once this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums goes into the bloodstream, this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums can go to different organs all over the body.",FALSE,TRUE
2465928,"And we do know things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke're all related to periodontal disease or gum disease.",TRUE,TRUE
2465929,"So things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke can also cross the blood-brain barrier and get into your brain.",FALSE,TRUE
2465930,"And that is Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's area of research, is that right?",TRUE,FALSE
2465931,The mouth-brain connection.,FALSE,FALSE
2465932,Yes.,FALSE,FALSE
2465933,"So initially we obtained a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and we examined Alzheimer's disease brains and non-Alzheimer's disease brains in the laboratory and looking for signatures of DNA from bacteria in the mouth, as well as any proteins that might be associated with bacteria in the mouth.",TRUE,FALSE
2465934,And we found signatures of DNA from these bacteria from the gum were exclusively within the Alzheimer's disease brains and not in the non-Alzheimer's control brains.,TRUE,TRUE
2465935,"So you're looking at a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients, it was only in the Alzheimer's disease's patients that you actually found the presence of these bacteria from the gum?",TRUE,FALSE
2465936,That's correct.,FALSE,FALSE
2465937,"That must have been an exciting moment, also slightly disturbing.",FALSE,FALSE
2465938,"The idea that you can go from the mouth to the brain to dementia is a very big step, isn't it?",FALSE,FALSE
2465939,Absolutely.,FALSE,FALSE
2465940,"As soon as we published our first study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, we were constantly being asked, well, can you show us that these bacteria from the gum actually get to the brain?",TRUE,TRUE
2465941,It's incredible.,FALSE,FALSE
2465942,So the next study we conducted was in collaboration with the University of Florida.,TRUE,FALSE
2465943,So what the University of Florida did was the University of Florida caused periodontal disease experimentally in mice and what we found was that bacteria had entered the brains of mice.,TRUE,TRUE
2465944,Clearly the message is that oral health is unbelievably important for your body and your and what are the best ways of looking after your teeth and your mouth generally?,FALSE,FALSE
2465945,What are Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry's top tips?,FALSE,FALSE
2465946,Top tips are obviously clean your mouth twice a day at least for two minutes each time.,FALSE,FALSE
2465947,"First thing in the morning, last thing at night.",FALSE,FALSE
2465948,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush it,FALSE,FALSE
2465949,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush fluoride toothpaste and then you can let some of fluoride toothpaste linger on into your teeth and gums so that fluoride toothpaste has the added protection for a little bit longer to act on the teeth.,FALSE,FALSE
2465950,So I'm told spit but don't rinse.,FALSE,FALSE
2465951,What about the tongue?,FALSE,FALSE
2465952,Do you do anything with your tongue?,FALSE,FALSE
2465953,"Well, our research has actually shown the tongue gets very dirty.",TRUE,FALSE
2465954,That was a surprise.,FALSE,FALSE
2465955,"Definitely, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think it's important to clean the tongue.",FALSE,TRUE
2465956,What do Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think about mouthwashes?,FALSE,FALSE
2465957,Good or bad?,FALSE,FALSE
2465958,"Well, Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry think mouthwashes have mouthwashes's place.",FALSE,FALSE
2465959,We should really go by when the dentist has recommended mouthwashes's use and for how long.,FALSE,FALSE
2465960,"Alternatively, if you feel that you want to use a mouthwash then Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry would certainly make sure that you understand the instructions on a mouthwash.",FALSE,FALSE
2465961,So brush for two minutes including your tongue and just spit.,FALSE,FALSE
2465962,Don't rinse your mouth afterwards.,FALSE,FALSE
2465963,Most of us would also benefit from flossing or using interdental brushes before we brush our teeth.,FALSE,FALSE
2465964,A study of dental students in Iran found that flossing before rather than after removed the most plaque.,TRUE,TRUE
2465965,Another tip from the British Dental Association is to brush before breakfast and to wait a full hour after your evening meal to brush again.,TRUE,TRUE
2465966,"And that's because eating creates acid in the mouth, weakening your enamel.",FALSE,FALSE
2465967,Brushing too soon after a meal can actually damage your teeth.,FALSE,TRUE
2465968,So there we go.,FALSE,FALSE
2465969,Let's check in with Lurie one final time.,FALSE,FALSE
2465970,Let's find out if Lurie has been able to stick to Lurie's new oral hygiene routine.,FALSE,FALSE
2465971,It's the end of the week and I've actually really enjoyed the task that I was given.,FALSE,FALSE
2465972,Lurie've really surprised Lurie by how relaxing Lurie found the interdental brushes.,TRUE,FALSE
2465973,Aesthetically the task that I was given's been brilliant.,FALSE,FALSE
2465974,Lurie's teeth have never looked this good.,FALSE,FALSE
2465975,"People have even commented on how white My teeth are, which has never happened before.",TRUE,FALSE
2465976,"But it's also really good to know that Lurie am doing something that could prevent dementia, could reduce Lurie's chance of getting heart disease.",FALSE,FALSE
2465977,So it's definitely a win-win and definitely something that Lurie will continue doing as we go forward.,FALSE,FALSE
2465978,I'm delighted to hear that Lurie will be sticking with Lurie's new routine.,FALSE,FALSE
2465979,I've also been paying particular attention to my dental hygiene the week.,TRUE,FALSE
2465980,"I already regularly flossed and brushed my teeth before the task that I was given, but since Lurie started using those plaque disclosing tablets, I've begun to focus on areas where I obviously hadn't been that thorough.",TRUE,FALSE
2465981,"I do believe that doing this will not only help me keep my teeth for as long as possible, but also offer health benefits beyond my mouth.",FALSE,FALSE
2465982,"Floss or use an interdental brush, then apply the electric toothbrush and your gums, your heart and your brain will thank you.",FALSE,FALSE
2465983,So that's it.,FALSE,FALSE
2465984,"It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",FALSE,FALSE

2465988,Officials say a case of mass hysteria broke out at a girl's school.,TRUE,TRUE
2465989,What starts with a case of mass hysteria spreading through a school leads us to consider one of the most profound issues of our time.,FALSE,FALSE
2465990,Young people are so concerned about the state of the earth and then Young people are labelled as hysterical.,FALSE,FALSE
2465991,"I'm Matthew Side and in the new season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast, Sideways, I'd like to tell you stories of seeing the world differently and explore the ideas that shape our lives.",FALSE,FALSE
2465992,From the strange illness and what the strange illness tells us about our collective anxieties to a 100-year riddle which prompts thoughts of mortality.,FALSE,FALSE
