"If your cortisol is high in the afternoon or high in the evening, you might feel tired and wired.","There are two main hormones that regulate our circadian rhythm, explains Murray: cortisol “the alert hormone”, and melatonin, “the sleepy hormone.” Normal cortisol levels naturally spike in the morning to help you wake up—called the cortisol awakening response (CAR)—and reach their lowest point at night to help you fall asleep. (That’s also when melatonin levels begin to increase to induce sleep.) Too high cortisol in the evening and you might be lying awake at night or tossing and turning, impacting your overall sleep quality. When levels are extremely high, you’ll feel wired (but tired) and have difficulties staying asleep, notes Murray. If your cortisol levels are lower than they should be in the morning, you may not feel fully recovered and have a hard time starting your day (hence, reaching for caffeine.) You’ve likely heard about cortisol before in negative contexts, like high-stress situations or its role in “stress belly,” but there are some benefits of cortisol. When you have the right dose of cortisol at the right time, you’ll be more energized in the morning, fall asleep easier at night, improve blood sugar balance (which can also interrupt sleep), and reduce inflammation. As with most things, reaping these benefits is all about learning how to balance cortisol. Cortisol and exercise have a bit of a complicated relationship: it can increase and decrease cortisol, so strategizing your workouts is key. High-intensity or long-duration exercise can increase cortisol levels temporarily, so recovery in between more intense days is crucial. But planning longer and more intense workouts for your mornings may also help with sleep quality.",https://www.humnutrition.com/blog/cortisol-and-sleep/,FALSE,SUPPORTS
"If your cortisol is high in the afternoon or high in the evening, you might feel tired and wired.","The lower levels of cortisol can play havoc with our energy levels throughout the day. In a healthy person, cortisol reaches its highest level early in the morning before declining gradually throughout the day. However, some Adrenal Fatigue sufferers experience spikes in cortisol in the late afternoon and evening, often leading to insomnia. A typical progression is to find yourself tired all day, then suddenly get a bounce in your energy levels late in the evening. This tends to occur in the earlier stages of Adrenal Fatigue, when the adrenals are still capable of producing significant amounts of cortisol and adrenaline. This can be caused by one of two factors. Adrenal Fatigue sufferers in the early stages of their condition tend to be under significant stress, and therefore their adrenaline and cortisol levels are high. This interrupts the natural 24-hour cycle of cortisol levels, leading to a state of alertness in the evening that prevents restful sleep. Those Adrenal Fatigue sufferers who are at a later stage of the condition will have consistently lower levels of cortisol. However, their blood sugar will tend to be much lower during the early morning (cortisol regulates blood sugar too), or their blood sugar with be unstable, swinging low and high depending on type of food and if you skip meals. Your body realizes it’s hungry and forces you to wake up. Many Adrenal Fatigue sufferers are chronic late-night snackers for exactly this reason.

Or, as you experienced, you may fall asleep and then wake up around 1 – 4 a.m. Yikes! When your body’s stress response and blood sugars stay balanced, your pineal gland produces melatonin that pulses strongly in the late afternoon and evening to help you sleep, simultaneously allowing for your cortisol levels to drop off so that you feel calm and sleepy at night. Eat most of your daily intake of smart carbohydrates in the evening. Remember to cut out the white breads, flours, rice and potatoes. Ditch the diet.

[27], the total polyphenolic content found in matcha tea falls within the range of 169–273 mg GAE/g. However, Nishitani and Sagesaka [28] observed a lower polyphenol content in matcha than in other green teas. It was then suggested that such a result may be due to the shading of the tea plants, which inhibits polyphenol synthesis. The distinctly high antioxidant potential of matcha can also be attributed to the grinding process and, ultimately, the powdered form. Fujioka et al. [52] demonstrated that infusions made by steeping tea leaves have a lower polyphenol content than those made from the powdered form. Studies confirming the high antioxidant potential of tea beverages claim that it originates from the considerable content of catechins, a type of phenolic compound with beneficial effects on human health [1,10,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Green tea contains four main catechins, i.e., (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), of which the latter is the most active and abundant [22,23]. High polyphenolic content has a greater capacity for scavenging free radicals than vitamin C on its own. Phenolic compounds occur naturally in the leaves of Camellia sinensis.

(2) Steroid hormones are a category of hormones synthesized naturally in the body from cholesterol. Collectively, they carry out a wide range of functions in the body. Cortisol, specifically, plays a role in metabolism. It stimulates the liver to increase the production of blood sugar. It also helps the body convert fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into usable energy. This connection between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands forms the backbone of the body’s stress response system. Levels of the hormone cortisol rise and fall naturally throughout the day. Cortisol levels reach their lowest levels late at night — usually around midnight. From there, levels begin to rise. Cortisol reaches its highest level in the body early in the morning, peaking around 9 a.m., before beginning to decline again throughout the later day. Blood samples may be taken from a vein in the arm in the morning, when levels are highest, or samples may also be taken around 4 in the afternoon, when levels should be considerably lower. The blood test for low cortisol is done by measuring levels in the blood both before and an hour after the injection of a drug called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
