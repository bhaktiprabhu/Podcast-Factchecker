Nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are nutrient dense foods with complex matrices rich in unsaturated fatty and other bioactive compounds: high-quality vegetable protein, fiber, minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. By virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially impact health outcomes. The first clinical trial using nuts was the Loma Linda University walnut study, published in 1993 [2]. In this landmark study, a cholesterol-lowering diet that provided 20% of energy from walnuts and 31% of energy from fat, of which 6% came from SFA and 16% from PUFA, was compared to a standard Step-I diet that provided 30% of energy from fat, of which 10% was from SFA and 10% from PUFA. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly by 12% and 18%, respectively in the healthy subjects studied.

There is some evidence that nuts may have beneficial effects on weight loss and maintenance, although more research is needed. However, research suggests that frequent snacking can promote feelings of satiety throughout the day, which results in overall lower daily energy intake [50]. This suggests that snacking behavior itself is not undesirable and may present an opportunity for the addition of healthy foods, such as nuts, into the diet [51]. A recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that regular consumption of nuts was associated with increased daily energy intake and lower hunger but had no effect on weight or feelings of fullness [52]. The increase in daily energy intake was lower than the amount of energy consumed from the nuts, which may be due to the lower amount of available energy from nuts following digestion [16,53]. In an analysis of three prospective cohorts that included 120,877 US women and men with follow-ups ranging from 1986 to 2006 [75], each four-year weight change was inversely associated with a one-serving increment in the intake of nuts (−0.26 kg), fruit (−0.22 kg), vegetables (−0.10 kg), whole grains (−0.17 kg) and yogurt (−0.37 kg), whereas weight gain was positively associated with the intake of potato chips (0.77 kg), potatoes or fries (0.58 kg), sugar-sweetened beverages (0.45 kg), unprocessed red meats (0.43 kg) and processed meats (0.42 kg).

"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.","Omega-6 fatty acids provide precursors for pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid, providing the theoretical impetus to maintain a higher quantity of omega-6. Eating higher amounts of nuts would worsen this ratio, as most contain very large amount of omega-6 fatty acids. This ratio is of practical benefit in that this ratio needs to be lower to obtain a high amount of omega-3 while taking a reasonable amount of total fats in the diet to maintain body weight. One concern of increasing dietary intake of certain foods such as nuts (considering that one gram of fat is equal to 9 calories) is potentially increasing caloric consumption in a population with a very high and increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity.37–40 The results are conflicting, but, in general, with whole nut supplements, there is no significant weight gain.16 In fact, in free-living individuals eating a Mediterranean diet, high levels of nut consumption are correlated with a lower incidence of obesity and weight gain,16,41 which may be due to increased satiety associated with nut consumption. There is a general perception that fat intake increases cardiovascular (CV) risk. We review the literature regarding the consumption of a high fat food, nuts, and CV risk.

"In fact, those with higher nut intake tend to have lower body weight or lower body fat.","An important source of plant protein, antioxidants, dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals, nuts have been traditionally viewed as a nutrient-dense food. In recent years, consumption of nuts has been increasingly evidenced to have a beneficial effect on CHD. Yet at the same time, nuts are also a high-fat (50–75% of their weight) and, thus, energy-dense food. Understandably, in light of the current obesity epidemic, questions arise as to whether the reported beneficial effects of nuts on coronary risk reduction and lipid serum and lipoprotein profile outweigh the detrimental effects of possible weight gain. Does current evidence bear out this concern? There is growing literature suggesting that regular consumption of nuts does not have the expected impact on body weight. Epidemiological data do not support the disquiet regarding weight gain and nut consumption. In fact, in diet patterns where nuts are an integral part, such as in Mediterranean countries, an inverse association with BMI and obesity is seen. A similar relationship is found in the United States, where nuts are not part of the traditional diet. Based on US national data on nut intake, we have previously reported that nut eaters have a lower BMI than those not consuming nuts regularly. Interestingly, energy intake among nut consumers is higher. Also, among nut eaters, the amount of nuts in their diet shows no association with BMI. Results from the Adventist Health Study, the first longitudinal study relating nut consumption to decreased risk of CHD, further support these findings but also suggest that those who included nuts in their diet more frequently were thinner than those who did not. Three other cohort studies have found an inverse or no relationship between nut consumption and BMI. Ecological and observational epidemiological data relating nut consumption and lower BMI, although interesting, could be partially explained by reverse causation: obese people may tend to avoid nuts while lean individuals may have fewer reservations about consuming them. A recent review of over twenty studies noted that no increase in body weight occurs when nuts are added to participants’ diets in well-controlled feeding trials. These studies, it must be noted, had a primary objective to investigate the effect of nuts on CVD risk factors. In these types of studies, the impact of nuts on body weight may be arguably related to the fact that researchers carefully adjust the energy level based on body weight changes. Although differing in methodology and dietary control, collectively these investigations provide substantial evidence that short-term consumption of moderate to large amounts of nuts does not increase body weight. Few intervention studies have specifically investigated the connection between nut consumption and body weight as a main outcome. In this issue of the British Journal of Nutrition, Hollis & Mattes add to the evidence of two previous studies specifically investigating body weight changes after introducing a moderate consumption of nuts into the daily diet of free-living individuals. Fraser studied the effect of raw or dry-roasted almond supplementation (42–70 g/d) for 6 months on body weight changes in about eighty men and women. In another study, walnuts (28–56 g/d) were included in the daily diet of ninety men and women over the course of 6 months in a crossover fashion. These studies showed no increase or a slight increase in body weight. Similarly, in the report of Hollis & Mattes, 60 g/d raw, unsalted almonds were provided to twenty free-living women to be incorporated into their daily diets for 10 weeks without further dietary instructions. After this simple intervention, participants did not experience a change in body weight or body composition measures. This report adds to the previous ones, a rigorous attempt to quantify the different channels through which the extra energy from the daily nut allotment is dissipated, since no apparent change in body weight occurred. To this effect they used doubly labelled water measurements. Multiple mechanisms of energy dissipation have been advanced to explain the lack of change in body weight after incorporating nuts into the diet, which can be summarized to two routes: decreased energy intake (from other foods) or increased energy expenditure (through physical exertion, metabolic rate or fecal residues). In the Hollis & Mattes trial, the largest route of energy dissipation was a decrease in energy intake. The ‘dietary compensation’ accounted for 74% of the energy dissipation. This is in accordance with the previous studies. The remainder was dissipated through increased energy expenditure. A greater fecal fat excretion accounted for 7% and through the doubly labelled water measurements the investigators were able to explain the remaining energy expenditure. Nuts share many physical and nutritional attributes. What has been learned about walnuts and almonds with regard to body weight may also apply to other nuts but needs to be evaluated. The unique matrix of nuts endows them with properties that may not be transferable to other man-made high-fat, energy-dense foods. After evaluating the epidemiological, metabolic and freeliving studies on nut supplements, the weight of the evidence with regard to the effect of nuts on body weight leans in favour of safely incorporating them into the daily diet.

Increases in the number of calories burnt can help us maintain or lose weight. Nuts help us feel full for longer: As well as fat, nuts are rich in protein and fibre. So, nuts help to keep us feeling full after we eat them, meaning we’re likely to eat less at later meals.

The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,"Probably because nuts are fatty foods containing substantial amounts of fiber, their chronic consumption in a free feeding situation causes satiation and elicits a strong dietary compensation, whereby intake of other energy-dense foods is curtailed, which accounts for roughly two thirds of the energy derived from nuts [135,141]. Increased satiation subsequent to nut consumption has been more difficult to detect in acute studies [98,142]. An enhanced thermogenic effect of nut intake was also postulated based on findings from a 19-week feeding trial with peanuts (88 g/day) in healthy subjects, who showed an 11% increase in resting energy expenditure [136]. These findings could not be reproduced in acute studies with walnuts [98,142]. Fat malabsorption, documented during nut diets as increased fecal fat excretion, also can contribute to the lack of weight gain. Third, four clinical studies specifically investigated the effects on body weight of supplementing the customary diets of free-living subjects with nuts without constraints on energy balance [135,136,137,138]. In these studies, sizeable quantities of peanuts, almonds or walnuts were provided for daily consumption during periods ranging from eight weeks to six months, without advice on how to include them in their diet. Compared with the corresponding control diet periods, there were insignificant increases or no changes in body weight after the nut diets in all these studies. However, as thoroughly reviewed [13,16,26,27], there is considerable scientific evidence indicating that there are no adverse effects of frequent nut consumption on energy balance or body weight. Some studies suggest that nut consumption might even help lose weight. First, the epidemiological studies that related the frequency of nut consumption with a reduction of incident CHD [1,39,40,41] or diabetes [46] showed a neutral or even inverse association between nut intake and BMI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257681/,False,
The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,"Eating Nuts May Even Boost Weight Loss Several large observational studies have found that more frequent nut consumption is associated with a lower body weight ( 12 , 13 , 21 , 22 ). It’s not clear why this is, but it may be partly due to the healthier lifestyle choices of those who eat nuts. However, human studies show that including nuts as part of a weight loss diet does not hinder weight loss. In fact, it often boosts weight loss ( 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ). For example, one study of 65 overweight or obese individuals compared a low-calorie diet supplemented with almonds to a low-calorie diet supplemented with complex carbs. They consumed equal amounts of calories, protein, cholesterol and saturated fat. At the end of the 24-week period, those on the almond diet had a 62% greater reduction in weight and BMI, 50% greater reduction in waist circumference and 56% greater reduction in fat mass ( 23 ). In other studies, calorie-controlled diets containing nuts resulted in a similar amount of weight loss as a calorie-controlled, nut-free diet. However, the group consuming nuts experienced improvements in cholesterol, including a reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. This benefit was not experienced by those consuming the nut-free diets ( 26 , 27 ). Summary: Regularly eating nuts as part of a weight loss diet can boost weight loss and improve cholesterol. Nuts Can Help Reduce Your Appetite and Increase Feelings of Fullness Adding nuts to the diet has been linked to reduced hunger and feeling full for longer ( 28 , 29 ). For example, snacking on almonds has been shown to reduce hunger and cravings ( 28 ). In one study, over 200 people were told to eat a portion of peanuts as a snack. The result was that they naturally ate fewer calories later in the day. This effect was greater when peanuts were eaten as a snack, rather than at a main meal ( 30 ). It’s thought that their appetite-suppressing effects are likely due to the increased production of the hormones peptide YY (PYY) and/or cholecystokinin (CCK), both of which help regulate appetite ( 31 ). The theory is that the high protein and high unsaturated fat content may be responsible for this effect ( 31 , 32 ). Studies suggest that 54–104% of the extra calories that come from adding nuts to the diet are canceled out by a natural reduction in the intake of other foods ( 18 , 19 ). In other words, eating nuts as a snack increases feelings of fullness, which results in eating less of other foods ( 33 ). Summary: Nut consumption is associated with reduced appetite and increased feelings of fullness. This means that people eating them may naturally eat less throughout the day. Only Some of The Fat Is Absorbed During Digestion The structure and high fiber content of nuts means that unless they are ground up or chewed completely, a good proportion will pass through the gut undigested. Instead, it’s emptied into the bowels. As a result, some of the nutrients, such as fat, won’t be absorbed and are instead lost in feces. This is another reason why nuts seem to be weight loss friendly. In fact, studies have found that after eating nuts, the amount of fat lost through feces increased by 5% to over 20% ( 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ). This suggests that a good portion of the fat in nuts is not even absorbed by your body. Interestingly, how nuts are processed may have a large effect on how well nutrients like fat are absorbed. For example, one study found that the amount of fat excreted in the feces was greater for whole peanuts (17.8%) than peanut butter (7%) or peanut oil (4.5%) ( 35 ). Roasting nuts may also increase the absorption of their nutrients ( 37 ). Therefore, the absorption of fat and calories from nuts is likely to be the least when you eat them whole. Summary: Some of the fat in nuts is not well absorbed and instead removed in the feces. Fat loss is likely greater after consuming whole nuts.",https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nuts-and-weight-loss,False,
The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,"A recent systematic review has found that participants decreased their body fat in studies that instructed nuts to be substituted into the eating pattern, yet no change in participant body weight was found in studies which did not provide substitution instructions [14]. An understanding of the reasons for this difference is not well established. Studies have been conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the lack of association between nut intake and body weight. Nuts have a hunger-suppressing effect, yet their consumption does not promote fullness [13,18]. Hence, it is thought that the energy contained within nuts may be compensated for at later eating events [[19], [20], [21]]. That is, a reduction in energy intake may be provoked by the previous consumption of nuts. The meta-analyses identified a nonsignificant increase in REE associated with nut consumption (weighted mean difference: 28.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: −10.7, 67.8 kcal/d). This study provided support for energy compensation as a potential mechanism for a lack of association between nut consumption and body weight, whereas no evidence was found for EE as an energy-regulating mechanism of nuts. The strengths of this review include the consideration of 2 energy regulation mechanisms of nuts—energy compensation and increased REE—to understand the lack of an effect of nut consumption on body weight previously reported in the literature [[13], [14], [15]]. Furthermore, in EE studies, both acute and chronic effects were explored to further understand this mechanism. A meta-analysis was conducted to explore the effect of chronic nut consumption on REE. However, this review has some limitations. Chestnuts were eligible for inclusion in this review because they are botanically considered a tree nut. However, they have a different nutrient composition to other tree nuts and peanuts, and for this reason, they are usually excluded from nut-related research.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10102987/,False,
The third reason being there are some studies showing that nut consumption can actually increase how energy is burned in the body when we consume nuts.,"In addition, incomplete mastication of nuts may lead to increased energy loss via feces, which contributes to energy availability of nuts and thus a lower energy intake. Furthermore, consuming nuts at expense of red meat and refined carbohydrates may also contribute to less weight gain and lower risk of chronic diseases. ... Conceptual framework of potential mechanisms linking nut consumption to decreased body weight and weight gain [86]. Cumulative evidence from long-term large cohort studies supports that an increased consumption of nuts, including total nuts and different types of nuts, is associated with less weight gain and lower risk of obesity, despite being calorically dense. The consumption of nuts, being a higher-fat plant food, is restricted by some in order to minimize weight gain. In this review, we discuss several factors related to energy intake from nuts, including food matrix and its impact on digestibility, and the role of nuts in regulating appetite. We review the data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies conducted to examine the relationship between nut intake and body weight or body mass index. Over several decades, the health benefits of consuming nuts have been investigated, resulting in a large body of evidence that nuts can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The consumption of nuts, being a higher-fat plant food, is restricted by some in order to minimize weight gain.
