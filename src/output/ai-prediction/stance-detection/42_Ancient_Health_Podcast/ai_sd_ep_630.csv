"There's so many purposes for animals beyond just animals's companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too.","Companion animals can be beneficial for people’s mental health by providing motivation, companionship, stress relief and comfort, and helping to maintain healthy routines [8]. They can also be used for animal-assisted therapy to help people with mental illness, autism, and developmental disorders [9], performing emotional work (e.g. easing worries), practical work (e.g. symptom distraction), and biographical work (e.g. a sense of identity and self-worth) [10]. Overall, companion animals are beneficial to the emotional, cognitive, behavioural, educational, and social development of children and youth. In young people, the presence of a companion animal can fulfil attachment needs, ease anxiety and loneliness, improve self-esteem, facilitate emotional regulation, help build resilience and foster empathy [14]. The presence of a companion animal has been associated with improved learning outcomes (e.g. literacy, verbal skills) as animals may stimulate curiosity, reduce stress, and provide a source of non-judgemental and unconditional support [15]. Growing up with companion animals has also been associated with a lower incidence of allergies in later life [13].",https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/what-are-the-benefits-of-companion-animals-to-human-health/,SUPPORTS,SUPPORTS

Is that companionship beneficial to our health? Is that companionship beneficial to our health? The better we understand the human-animal bond, the more we can use it to improve people’s lives. This article summarizes what is known and not known about how animals help improve the health and well-being of people, and what the implications might be for helping people who don’t have pets of their own. People who have pets know that there are many benefits to having a companion animal, but we do not yet know under what circumstances those benefits are most likely. If research shows specific health benefits under specific circumstances, that information can be used to change policies in ways that benefit even more adults and children, by influencing rules and regulations for schools, health or assisted living facilities, residential treatment centers, and other places where people’s exposure to animals is sometimes discouraged but could potentially be encouraged.",https://www.center4research.org/benefits-pets-human-health/,SUPPORTS,SUPPORTS

The companionship of an animal can offer comfort, help ease anxiety, and build self-confidence for people anxious about going out into the world. Because pets tend to live in the moment—they don’t worry about what happened yesterday or what might happen tomorrow—they can help you become more mindful and appreciate the joy of the present. Pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Caring for an animal can help children grow up more secure and active. Pets also provide valuable companionship for older adults. Perhaps most importantly, though, a pet can add real joy and unconditional love to your life. Companionship can help prevent illness and even add years to your life, while isolation and loneliness can trigger symptoms of depression. Caring for an animal can help make you feel needed and wanted, and take the focus away from your problems, especially if you live alone.",https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/mood-boosting-power-of-dogs.htm,SUPPORTS,SUPPORTS

So microbial composition in infants is actually very low in terms of diversity.,"In conclusion, by a larger cohort study than before, differences in gut microbiota among infants who were fed exclusively by breast milk or a single kind of formulas were obtained from this study, contributing further to our understanding of early gut microbial colonization, with more solid data than previous studies with mixed feeding patterns. Faecal diversity was lower in breast-fed infants than formula-fed ones in early life period, but increased significantly after solid foods introduction. A low diversity of the gut microbiota in early life appeared to characterize a healthy gut, if caused by breastfeeding, which was different from theories in adults. There were differences in bacterial composition in infants according to different feeding types, and even different formulas had different effects on microbiota, which we could not ignore in future research. This study presented initial data facilitating further research that will help us understand the importance of breastfeeding to gut microbiota in early life period. We found that in breast-fed group, α diversity remained unchanged before 3 months of age, but increased significantly in 6 months of age. Previously studies have reported that faecal bacterial diversity increases with age, indicating a more complex microbial community over time8,9. Studies have shown that infants who are exclusively breast-fed have lower microbial diversity, compared with formula-fed babies whose gut microbiota is more diverse and similar to older children10,11,12. The difference of gut microbial diversity between breast-fed and formula-fed babies is also reported in animal research in tiger cubs13. We also found that among different groups, α diversity was lower in breast-fed group than formula-fed groups in 40 days of age. In adults, low gut microbial diversity has been linked to diseases in recent studies. In infants, breast milk may be the major determinant of a lower gut microbial diversity, because specific bacteria are selected for degrading particular oligosaccharides in breast milk. The predomination of infant-type Bifidobacteria during breastfeeding results in a low bacterial diversity, but it is beneficial for babies’ health. For example, the infant-type Bifidobacteria has a large impact on the maturation of the immune system, which may help reduce the incidence of infections in children. However, some diseases have been associated with a reduced microbial diversity in early life, such as eczema and asthma, which have been linked to low microbial diversity in 1 week–4 months of age. But the low microbial diversity is not coupled to Bifidobacterium abundance in these studies, and no reports have shown negative impacts of breastfeeding on development of asthma or allergies. The causality of lower diversity to diseases remains to be identified. What’s more, research has suggested that an immature gut microbial community can be “repaired” by introduction of adult-like microbes increasing greatly during introduction of solid foods in 6 months of age, which is within the development window of opportunity. Findings in adults cannot be inferred to infants regarding the association of gut microbial diversity with diseases, since the microbial ecosystem and the immune system of infants are quite different from adults4. Besides Bacteroides, other health promoting bacteria like Clostridia has been reported to be vital to provide mucosal barrier homeostasis during the neonatal period, which is necessary in the immature intestine6. Formula-fed infants tend to have a more diverse microbial community with increased Clostridia species9,12, which is in accordance with our finding. We also found Veillonella was lower in breast-fed infants than formula-fed ones. Although there is an analysis indicating that Veillonella has been associated with a lower incidence of asthma, it has not taken feeding patterns into consideration22. So more data are needed to clarify the specific roles of certain bacteria with regard to feeding types.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72635-x,REFUTES,SUPPORTS

The symbiotic relationship between host and microbes starts early in life and is important not only in terms of how the neonate microbiome ultimately develops, but also its potential impact on long-term infant health. A current ongoing debate within the scientific community is whether gut colonization starts during pregnancy or at birth. As with the study of the breast milk microbiome, characterizing microorganisms colonizing the fetus prior to birth requires sophisticated methodologies that distinguish resident microbes from those that temporarily colonize the sample.

"So despite rapid microbial colonization of the gut after birth, environmental microbes in the early postnatal period represent a critical exposure for early life immune programming.","Even before birth, fetal immune development relies on microbial products present in the placenta. In an experimental system in which germ-free mice were transiently colonized with genetically engineered E. coli HA107, maternal gut colonization influenced the offspring’s immune system by increasing the intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells and F4/80+CD11c+ mononuclear cells (iMNCs), and strongly altering the offspring’s intestinal transcriptional profiles (37). In comparison, the gut microbiome of infants born through cesarean sections (C-sections) was enriched in microbes associated with the skin, the mouth, and the surrounding environment. The infant’s gut habitat changes rapidly after birth with facultative anaerobes species (e.g., E. coli, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) colonizing first and consuming the available oxygen (79). A longitudinal study following 39 infants from birth demonstrated that mode of delivery impacts Bacteroides populations in the infant’s gut microbiota between 6 and 18 months of age (41). Notwithstanding, studies to date do suggest that the training of the immune system relies on a particular pattern of microbial diversity increasing from birth until 3 years old, and that disrupting this pattern can increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders.

Early life represents windows of both vulnerability and opportunity that impact the developing immune system. The cases above demonstrate that there can be short-term and lasting implications for lifelong health based on pre- and perinatal environmental exposures. These include potential inherited programing (genetic and epigenetic), derailed development due to altered metabolism (nutrition and toxicology), and inappropriate immune system decision-making (for both adaptive and innate arms). The human gut microbiome is acquired from local environments and is variable depending on numerous environmental influences, including geography, diet, and lifestyle (152). The human microbiota appears to have some implications in human health and disease, likely through participation in immunological education. Early life microbial exposure may be exceedingly important within the context of trained innate immunity. In this process, independent of adaptive immune mechanisms primary exposure to pathogen can alter innate immune cell programed responses to subsequent re-exposure. Seasonality is a multifactorial parameter to be considered for studies of human immunity, though evidence for long-term immune programing is limited.

There was also some indication of an interaction between ownership and sensitization, suggesting that ownership may exacerbate the risks associated with pet-specific sensitization but offer some protection against asthma in the absence of sensitization. Our findings do not support early-life cat and dog ownership in themselves increasing the risk of school-age asthma, but they do suggest that ownership may potentially exacerbate the risks associated with cat- and dog-specific allergic sensitization.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167492200149X,REFUTES,REFUTES
Allergies's a dysregulation of our immune system.,"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been reported in very high rates in the U.S. population. Deficiency has been implicated in various diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and many cancers. It has also been implicated in several allergic disorders and immune system dysregulation. The National Health and Nutrition examination survey (NHANES) in 2005-2006 was a cross-sectional survey performed in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics. It consists of an extensive interview performed at home and an examination performed at a mobile center. An allergy questionnaire was provided as interview data on self-reported allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Data were collected using the question, ""Has the doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have allergies?"" The laboratory parameter of vitamin D < 10 ng/mL was used to define severe VDD. The data were analyzed by logistic regression with SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) using the Procedure survey methods. Of 10,348 people who participated in the 2005-2006 NHANES survey, our final sample consisted of 4979 people in whom serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were completed after excluding subjects <20 years of age and those with missing vitamin D values. The VDD was positively correlated with prevalence of allergies. After adjusting the model for age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol, and educational status, the odds ratio still remained significant. There was also a positive correlation with allergy subtypes such as prevalence of rashes, sneezing, and sinus infections with low vitamin D. VDD related to the immune system dysregulation has been extensively reviewed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cffd33e0b1e8b8094489a249f749f9dc2bc077e,SUPPORTS,SUPPORTS

When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system. Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. An allergy starts when your immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader. The immune system then produces antibodies that remain on the alert for that particular allergen. When you're exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies can release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497,SUPPORTS,REFUTES

Fundamentally, an allergic reaction occurs when your body mistakenly recognizes something that really isn’t bad for you as a pathogen and attacks it (like pollen). The symptoms you feel are actually due to this immune response. This is actually true in a lot of cases. These are the types of allergic reactions that are responsible for most of the common allergic reactions (the ones you usually treat with the over the counter antihistamines, i.e. hay fever).

However, less is known about the activation of innate immunity during exposure to allergens. New insights into the innate immune system by sensors and their signaling cascades provide us with more important clues and a framework for understanding allergy disorders. Allergy is an increasing problem in the health sector, with a soaring number of patients in recent years. Accumulating evidence suggests the importance of the innate immune system in the development of allergy susceptibility. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize recent advances in the involvement of PRRs in allergic diseases, and improvements to current allergy treatment modalities.

Thus, each of these isotypes occupies a particular site in the body and has a particular role in defending the body against extracellular pathogens and their toxic products. Antibodies can accomplish this by direct interactions with pathogens or their products, for example by binding to active sites of toxins and neutralizing them or by blocking their ability to bind to host cells through specific receptors. IgA dimers are selectively transported across these epithelia into sites such as the lumen of the gut, where they neutralize toxins and viruses and block the entry of bacteria across the intestinal epithelium.

Thus, each of these isotypes occupies a particular site in the body and has a particular role in defending the body against extracellular pathogens and their toxic products. This distinction is not surprising, as IgG operates mainly in the body tissues, where accessory cells and molecules are available, whereas IgA operates mainly on epithelial surfaces where complement and phagocytes are not normally present, and therefore functions chiefly as a neutralizing antibody.

IgE is a Y-shaped protein, made of two light chains and two heavy chains of peptides (building blocks of protein). The heavy chains form the body and arms of the Y shape, and the light chains attach just to the arms of the Y shape. A defining characteristic of IgE is the heavy chains, called epsilon. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody—a protein produced by the immune system in response to a possible invader. It is primarily involved in the allergic response but also fights infections from parasites. Increased blood levels of IgE are associated with allergies (including atopic dermatitis), parasitic and certain viral infections, some types of immunodeficiency, inflammation, asthma, and some cancers, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, people who generate IgE to allergens can be negatively affected once they develop a sensitization.

Given that neonates were swabbed within seconds of delivery, and thus it would be coated with vaginal fluids, this result is hardly surprising. This does not necessarily demonstrate colonization, however.
