2434686,Right.,FALSE,False
2434687,"But 2020 was the big, like, gasp reveal.",FALSE,False
2434688,Yeah.,FALSE,False
2434689,"Well, we got UFOs in in 2020 because we had broken the ground in 2017 with that big front page story about ATIP, you know, the secret Pentagon unit that was investigating UFOs that no one knew about until we broke the story on the front page of the New York Times.",TRUE,True

2434705,"Yeah, I mean, it's a tough, taboo subject.",FALSE,False
2434706,And you can just define for our listeners what exactly are UFOs?,FALSE,False

2434708,"And, you know, people say, do you believe in UFOs?",FALSE,False
2434709,You don't have to believe in UFOs.,FALSE,False

2434733,the government don't go there.,FALSE,False

2434735,It's one step at a time.,FALSE,False
2434736,And it is pure speculation.,FALSE,False

2434742,"So then you say, well, who could be behind these UFOs?",FALSE,False
2434743,"I mean, that's pure speculation.",FALSE,False

2434766,"It wasn't a story that they 60 school kids who saw it subscribed to, but 60 school kids who saw it told us similar accounts.",TRUE,True
2434767,And 60 school kids who saw it were very innocent kids.,TRUE,False
2434768,60 school kids who saw it weren't conniving together to make up a story.,FALSE,False
2434769,"And when 60 school kids who saw it went to John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who is the subject of the book I wrote and said, well, how come no adults, you know, These things picked the one time when 60 school kids who saw it were at recess and no adults were present?",TRUE,False
2434770,"You know, how do you explain that?",FALSE,False

2434773,It's just what 60 school kids who saw it reported.,TRUE,False

2434775,Who knows?,FALSE,False

2434778,We now think we know.,FALSE,False
2434779,"So, you know, why these UAPs, UFOs do it this way, why these UAPs, UFOs're here, all good questions.",FALSE,False
2434780,"And how likely is it that it could be China, Russia or any or Israel or any other country?",FALSE,False

2434790,It just does not seem possible.,FALSE,False
2434791,"So that's why the experts that we've talked to at The New York Times, that The New York Times has talked to in the Pentagon and, you know, for our reporting have all said that it is unlikely to the point of impossibility that at least all these things can be explained by earthly adversaries.",TRUE,False
2434792,Because at least all these things tend to defy the laws of physics as we know the laws of physics as we know them.,FALSE,False
2434793,As we as we understand physics.,FALSE,False

2434803,"There's a lot we still don't understand, a huge amount, obviously.",FALSE,False

2434805,"But we don't understand things that could explain the movements, you know, the operations of these objects yet.",FALSE,False
2434806,It's certainly a Galileo moment that challenges the conventional thinking and deals with all sorts of skepticism out there.,FALSE,False
2434807,Absolutely.,FALSE,False
2434808,"One explanation I heard from a researcher at the Pentagon or had been at the Pentagon for some time, one theory is that the intelligent life form driving these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them, one of the reasons why these extraordinary machines, crafts, whatever you want to call them want nothing to do with us, it's the same sort of question.",TRUE,False

2434812,There's a lot of sightings around water.,FALSE,False
2434813,There tends to be some of these objects.,FALSE,False
2434814,And that there's a theory that maybe Earth is just a far flung fueling station for the aliens to go to other places.,FALSE,False
2434815,"Yeah, there was a lot in that question, Andrea.",FALSE,False
2434816,"Well, this is like a therapeutic conversation for me.",FALSE,False
2434817,I can finally talk to somebody.,FALSE,False

2434821,"They've been sighted in every country on Earth, just about every continent to all kinds of people for a very long time.",FALSE,False

2434823,"But there's something that that draws these things, you know, to to our area of the of the galaxy of the universe.",FALSE,False

2434827,There's certainly no evidence of that.,TRUE,False
2434828,There's just stories.,FALSE,False

2434835,John Mackett didn't get close.,FALSE,True
2434836,John Mackett raised a lot of good questions.,FALSE,False

2434839,"OK, but hundreds of people told hundreds of people's stories to John Mackett about encounters that hundreds of people believed hundreds of people had and not only believed, but that hundreds of people that in some cases third parties confirmed hundreds of people had with these beings, whatever you want to call these objects.",TRUE,False
2434840,So John Mackett compiled a lot of data.,FALSE,True
2434841,John Mackett never figured a lot of data out.,TRUE,False

2434845,"all these accounts were not similar to the point that, you know, everybody was telling one story that they kind of agreed on.",FALSE,False
2434846,But there was a similarity to all these accounts that convinced John Mackett that they had all experienced something that could not be explained.,FALSE,False
