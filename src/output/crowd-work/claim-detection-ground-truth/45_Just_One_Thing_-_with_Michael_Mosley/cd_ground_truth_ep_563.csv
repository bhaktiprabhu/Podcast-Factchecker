2465351,That sounds okay.,False,
2465352,"Yeah, Yushi, an office worker'm definitely up for giving it a go.",False,
2465353,Be aware that it is a very bright yellow colour and it can stain.,False,Low
2465354,That sounds good.,False,
2465355,Thanks for the heads up.,False,
2465356,"I've asked Yushi, an office worker to spice things up with turmeric because turmeric not only adds colour and flavouring to food, turmeric's also been linked to some surprising health claims, from boosting attention and working memory to improving asthma and eczema.",True,High
2465357,The link between turmeric and health is nothing new.,True,Medium
2465358,turmeric's been used in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years to alleviate liver problems and digestive ailments.,True,High
2465359,"Over the last couple of decades or so, scientific research into turmeric and in particular into its active ingredient curcumin has exploded, with lots of studies exploring the health effects of turmeric.",True,High
2465360,And some of the findings have been impressive.,False,
2465361,Let's start with the brain.,False,
2465362,"A Singaporean study in 2022, following 2,700 older people for nearly five years, found those who ate a lot of turmeric-rich curries, like korma, kept those who ate a lot of turmeric-rich curries, like korma's brains in better shape, when measured for things like working memory and problem-solving, than those who didn't.",True,High
2465363,"The authors suggest that it's the curcumin, which is a polyphenol in the turmeric, which is responsible for these positive effects.",True,High
2465364,"Now, a big problem with curcumin is that normally very little of curcumin gets absorbed.",False,Medium
2465365,"So The authors think that one of the reasons why The authors saw such good results in The authors's study is because when you consume curcumin with fat and certain spices, this helps your body to absorb more of curcumin.",True,High
2465366,It's a great excuse to add curcumin to curry.,False,
2465367,"And if you don't fancy curry, then you might consider a curcumin supplement.",False,
2465368,"In an Australian study where they gave curcumin in pill form to 80 older individuals, they found that compared to placebo, taking curcumin in pill form improved working memory and reduced fatigue.",True,High
2465369,One way curcumin in pill form might be working is by reducing inflammation.,True,High
2465370,"In a recent Japanese study where overweight but otherwise healthy participants were randomly allocated to placebo or curcumin extract, they found those taking curcumin extract had lower levels of an inflammatory marker in the blood called C-reactive protein.",True,High

2465372,I'll be delving into that with an expert shortly.,False,

2465379,Yushi'm looking forward to the rest of the week.,False,
2465380,"We'll catch up with Yushi, an office worker at the end of the week and see if Yushi, an office worker can find some tasty ways to incorporate turmeric into Yushi, an office worker's diet.",False,
2465381,"But now to get the lowdown on turmeric, I'm speaking to Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia.",False,
2465382,G'day.,False,
2465383,"Good day, Michael.",False,
2465384,"Now, what would Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia say are the main benefits of turmeric?",False,
2465385,"Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, that is a traditional Indian medicine, as well as traditional Chinese medicine.",True,Medium
2465386,"But only recently, people have identified the active components such as the curcumin.",False,
2465387,So turmeric has been mainly known as an anti-inflammatory agent.,True,High
2465388,It is also known to be an antioxidant.,True,High
2465389,"Therefore, it can be useful for chronic conditions.",True,Medium
2465390,It's also got antifungal properties and some wound healing properties.,True,High
2465391,So what not?,False,
2465392,It's got many properties.,False,
2465393,"Now, Michael know you have done clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis.",False,
2465394,Can Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia tell Michael about clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis?,False,
2465395,So clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis involved 70 patients.,False,
2465396,So Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia selected patients based on pain as well as based on the joint inflammation.,False,
2465397,So Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia randomized 35 people into placebo group and 35 people into the active group who received the turmeric extract.,False,
2465398,And then Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia followed 70 patients over 12 weeks.,False,
2465399,And Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia found that the participants who were taking the turmeric extract had relief in pain compared to placebo group.,True,High
2465400,"Obviously, both placebo and treatment group both reduced the knee pain.",False,High
2465401,But treatment group had a further reduction compared to placebo group.,False,High
2465402,Right.,False,
2465403,"Because we know the placebo effect is very powerful, particularly in pain.",False,Medium
2465404,"So oddly enough, you would actually have to be quite impressive to outdo placebo in this context.",False,
2465405,And did it affect the amount of pain medication 35 people into the active group who received the turmeric extract were taking?,False,
2465406,"Yeah, that's one of the interesting or secondary outcomes of clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis was that there was a reduction in the number of medications which 70 patients were taking for 70 patients's knee pain.",True,High
2465407,So how does turmeric compare to a standard painkiller like ibuprofen?,False,
2465408,"In our trial, we did not really compare turmeric extract with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.",False,
2465409,"However, we can indirectly compare the effect size of the treatment.",False,
2465410,That means we found a modest effect of the treatment compared to placebo.,False,Medium
2465411,"And similarly, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen have got only a modest effect.",True,Medium
2465412,-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen seems to have a lot of contraindications.,False,
2465413,That means Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen cannot be taken in older patients.,True,Medium
2465414,And a lot of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen have more severe adverse events such as the gastrointestinal bleeding or cardiovascular events.,True,Medium
2465415,"So compared to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen, there seems to be no adverse event for turmeric extract.",True,High
2465416,Right.,False,
2465417,Did you also see an anti-inflammatory effect?,False,
2465418,Did 70 patients actually have less inflammation in the joint?,False,
2465419,the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia did not find a significant difference in local inflammation.,False,Medium
2465420,And the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia also tested whether the turmeric consumption led to a reduction in the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.,False,High
2465421,And an expert did not find a significant effect of the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.,False,
2465422,Because of the treatment of turmeric.,False,
2465423,So it's possible there is something else going on.,False,
2465424,That turmeric is not necessarily acting by reducing inflammation.,False,High
2465425,What do Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia think that something else might be?,False,
2465426,So there is possibly other mechanisms that could have explained the reduction in pain.,False,
2465427,Some studies suggest that turmeric might have an effect in the gut-brain axis that turmeric extracts.,True,High
2465428,Especially the curcumin can actually improve a certain type of bacterial colony which reduces the inflammation.,True,High
2465429,So there is plenty of other evidence to say that turmeric can reduce inflammation in a systemic level and which is evidenced in the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream as well.,True,High
2465430,OK.,False,
2465431,Now you are obviously focusing on osteoarthritis which is an inflammatory condition in the knee.,False,
2465432,Do Michael think it could be beneficial for other types of pain?,False,
2465433,So what we have found that it's been effective for acute pain as well.,True,High
2465434,It's not just for the chronic conditions as well.,False,
2465435,But it's for normal healthy people.,False,
2465436,It can be used to reduce the pain.,False,High
2465437,Although it still needs more research in this area.,False,
2465438,"If people do want to boost people's turmeric consumption, what's the best way of doing so?",False,
2465439,So if people want to increase the active component in the turmeric such as the curcumin in people's body.,False,
2465440,The best way to do it is to combine the turmeric with some pepper because piperine seems to increase the bioavailability that means the increased absorption of curcumin in the body.,True,Medium
2465441,The other option is fatty food seems to increase the bioavailability of curcumin.,False,Medium
2465442,Obviously I've got an Indian heritage so I follow some of the Indian cuisine.,False,
2465443,So I pour oil first and then I put turmeric powder in oil.,False,
2465444,So it's good for taste and it's going to increase the bioavailability.,False,
2465445,"Right, that's the science.",False,
2465446,Now let's check in one more time with Yushi to see how Yushi's getting on with turmeric.,False,
2465447,It's the end of the week.,False,
2465448,The turmeric ended up tasting a lot nicer than I expected.,False,
2465449,And I surprised myself with the range of different dishes I was able to incorporate turmeric into.,False,

2465451,The turmeric gave The turmeric pancakes a really warm flavour.,False,
2465452,The turmeric worked quite well with savoury toppings.,False,

2465454,Overall Yushi found the challenge a great success.,False,
2465455,Yushi really enjoyed the challenge.,False,
2465456,I'm really glad to hear that Yushi has enjoyed Yushi's challenge and I've been adding more turmeric to my diet and I've discovered something novel which I do enjoy and something novel which I do enjoy is having turmeric as a latte.,False,
2465457,Now I've got some milk here and I'm going to add some milk to my milk frother.,False,
2465458,There we go.,False,
2465459,Nice and frost up.,False,
2465460,I'm adding a nice teaspoon of turmeric and then giving it a good old stir.,False,
2465461,And it's certainly a wonderfully orange colour.,False,
2465462,And the advantage of using milk is the fat means that I'm going to absorb more of the good stuff as well.,False,
2465463,It's also delicious.,False,
