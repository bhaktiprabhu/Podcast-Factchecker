2461335,We're so happy you've joined us.,FALSE,False
2461336,Let's dive into today's episode.,FALSE,False
2461337,"Hey, everybody.",FALSE,False
2461338,Welcome back.,FALSE,False
2461339,"the Ancient Health Podcast, where we educate you on real health solutions that will help transform the way you live, feel, and overcome disease naturally is the Ancient Health Podcast.",FALSE,True
2461340,"My name is Courtney, and I'm so glad that you've joined me today's.",FALSE,False
2461341,"I have to be honest, I have a special guest in the studio with me today's.",FALSE,False
2461342,today's episode is a special guest's first podcast.,FALSE,False
2461343,a special guest might be a little bit nervous.,FALSE,False
2461344,"So far, a special guest has tried to escape two different times, and a special guest's being forced against a special guest's will to join me.",FALSE,False
2461345,a special guest is not actually a human guest.,FALSE,False
2461346,a special guest is Bodhi.,FALSE,False
2461347,I would say that a special guest's a dog.,FALSE,False
2461348,"Maybe by genetics, a special guest is a dog.",FALSE,False
2461349,"But if you're needing a visual, a special guest is somewhat of a combination of the squirrel from Ice Age.",FALSE,False
2461350,You know the one with the big eyes that's always running around with the nut that the squirrel from Ice Age carries around?,FALSE,False
2461351,a special guest's kind of like half the squirrel from Ice Age.,FALSE,False
2461352,"And then if you are familiar, if you have kids and you know the movie, Lilo and Stitch, a special guest is Stitch, kind of crazy, also big eyes, kind of a big head, big ears.",FALSE,False
2461353,"So if you're walking, if you're out listening to this, you cannot see a special guest, that's kind of a good visual for you.",FALSE,False
2461354,So a special guest's quite the character.,FALSE,False
2461355,"But I bring a special guest on today's not because Dr. Motley is unavailable to join me for today's episode and he's the stand-in, but because we're actually talking about our pets.",FALSE,False
2461356,"We're going to talk about how dogs, specifically cats, dogs, specifically cats kind of fit the bill too.",FALSE,False
2461357,But some of the data that we're going to look at really looks at the influence of dogs in the house on our microbiome.,TRUE,False
2461358,And what's interesting is that animals really have always lived with humans.,FALSE,False
2461359,"Up until this really industrialized age, we've always cohabitated because we've relied on animals for...",FALSE,False
2461360,"Yeah, a special guest.",FALSE,False
2461361,Okay.,FALSE,False
2461362,a special guest's so excited to be here.,FALSE,False
2461363,I'm glad a special guest finally spoke up.,FALSE,False
2461364,a special guest's a little shy.,FALSE,False
2461365,But we've always grown up with animals because animals have been a part of how we live.,FALSE,False
2461366,"We utilize animals for food, we utilize animals to help manage crops, to ultimately regenerate our soil.",FALSE,True
2461367,"There's so many purposes for animals beyond just animals's companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too.",FALSE,False
2461368,"And today's episode, we're not going to talk about so many purposes for animals beyond just their companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too specifically, maybe we'll do another one.",FALSE,False
2461369,But what I want to focus on is how pets can influence your microbiome because pets bring so much to the table.,FALSE,False
2461370,"If you think about our animals, our animals're actually out making contact with the dirt and the soil and our animals're bringing the dirt and the soil into our house.",FALSE,False
2461371,"So animals are bringing things in from the outdoors, things that we normally wouldn't be probably exposed to.",FALSE,False
2461372,Most of us aren't running around our yard and putting our hands in the dirt.,FALSE,False
2461373,We're not really even grounding.,FALSE,False
2461374,We're just inside these sterile environments.,FALSE,False
2461375,We're not getting access to nature.,FALSE,False
2461376,And animals actually bring a lot of nature into our homes.,FALSE,False
2461377,But a lot of the studies that have been done on the influence of dogs on our health really relate to children.,TRUE,True
2461378,"And I found this so fascinating because there are a lot of people that maybe have kids and they also have pets or maybe think that, hey, pets might be a problem for my child.",FALSE,False
2461379,What if my dog gets my child sick?,FALSE,False
2461380,What if my cat gets my child sick?,FALSE,False
2461381,"And yes, you're exactly right to have concern because animals do have the ability to carry parasites and worms and things like parasites and worms.",FALSE,False
2461382,But what you've got to realize too is that animals bring a lot of microbial diversity.,FALSE,False
2461383,And a lot of microbial diversity's something that your child can share from.,FALSE,True
2461384,"Because in those early years, the first years, we're talking from infancy and birth all the way up to the first two and three years, their microbiome is heavily influenced by the environment that they're raised in.",FALSE,True
2461385,And so I want to bring to light a couple of things.,FALSE,False
2461386,"This might be something to consider, especially if maybe you're starting a family, maybe you have children, maybe you have a spouse that doesn't love animals.",FALSE,False
2461387,"I'm not going to say that a special guest is unloved in this house, but I can tell you that a special guest has more love from some of us than a special guest does others.",FALSE,False
2461388,"a special guest's also, okay, just a side note, a special guest is like one and a half years old.",FALSE,False
2461389,a special guest's completely untrained.,FALSE,False
2461390,"a special guest doesn't know a single command, and a special guest pretty much does whatever a special guest wants.",FALSE,False
2461391,So I'm okay with it.,FALSE,False
2461392,I have all the love in the world for Bodhi.,FALSE,False
2461393,Bodhi's like my sidekick.,FALSE,False
2461394,"However, not everybody feels the same way about Bodhi, including other family members.",FALSE,False
2461395,"Bodhi gets love from me, but I feel like that's enough.",FALSE,False
2461396,And Bodhi and I have a very strong bond and relationship.,FALSE,False
2461397,"So all right, Bodhi, do Bodhi feel good about that?",FALSE,False
2461398,"Okay, so let's get into the data.",FALSE,False
2461399,"So when we're talking about infants and babies, the microbial composition is shaped by a number of factors.",FALSE,False
2461400,"And a number of factors includes gestational age, the type of delivery that infants and babies had, so whether infants and babies were born vaginally or cesarean, and then the type of diet.",FALSE,False
2461401,"So if you think about, are infants and babies breastfed or are infants and babies formula fed?",FALSE,False
2461402,"And even if infants and babies've been exposed to antibiotics, because we have a number of children and children get sick in those first few months of life, and all of a sudden it's one antibiotic after another, which is just wiping out children's gut microbiome.",FALSE,True
2461403,So microbial composition in infants is actually very low in terms of diversity.,TRUE,True
2461404,"So it's so critical in those first few months of life that infants get flooded with these good bacteria, these good microbes to help build some resiliency because infants's immune system depends on it.",FALSE,True
2461405,"And even beyond that, infants's brain health, infants's hormones, like all of these things are the linchpin is infants's gut.",FALSE,True
2461406,"I mean, Hippocrates says all disease begins in the gut.",FALSE,True
2461407,And that's so true because the gut is the cornerstone element.,FALSE,False
2461408,"If your gut health is not intact, if your gut health is not resilient and strong, you are going to suffer in so many downstream ways.",FALSE,True
2461409,So there was this thing called the hygiene hypothesis.,FALSE,True
2461410,this thing called the hygiene hypothesis was first brought up in the late like 1980s.,TRUE,True
2461411,"And there were a bunch of epidemiological studies that were done that attribute the risk of allergic disease to overly hygienic environments, which this makes sense, right?",TRUE,False
2461412,"If you think about any newborn child being brought into a home, any newborn child're not going outside.",FALSE,False
2461413,any newborn child're not getting exposed to a lot of different things in the environment.,FALSE,True
2461414,And our homes have become increasingly sterilized.,TRUE,False
2461415,We have all these cleaning chemicals.,FALSE,False
2461416,"We have chemicals that are on our furniture, that are in the paint on the walls.",FALSE,True
2461417,"All of these things contribute to toxins, which toxins can modulate.",FALSE,False
2461418,Toxins can change the microbiome.,FALSE,True
2461419,So this thing called the hygiene hypothesis was first proposed in the late like 1980s.,TRUE,True
2461420,"And the idea is that as we become more sterilized in our homes and in our just overall environment, the risk of disease has actually increased.",TRUE,True
2461421,There's further evidence that gut microbial dysbiosis during infancy is associated with the development of allergic disease specifically.,TRUE,True
2461422,"And this is really because after a child is born, a lot of times a child are exposed to nothing but just the inside of a child's homes, right?",FALSE,False
2461423,"Because a lot of infants, I mean, granted, mom might be outside taking mom's baby for a walk, but for the most part, a lot of infants are only exposed to the things that are indoors.",FALSE,False
2461424,"And our indoor living environment has been proved to be far more toxic, including the air that we're breathing, right?",TRUE,False
2461425,"Because of all the off-gassing, so many different things that are in our homes.",FALSE,False
2461426,"On top of that, we have all of these different cleaning agents, these cleaning chemicals that are disrupting a lot of flora inside our homes.",FALSE,True
2461427,"So despite rapid microbial colonization of the gut after birth, environmental microbes in the early postnatal period represent a critical exposure for early life immune programming.",FALSE,False
2461428,And we find that this can have long-term consequences.,TRUE,False
2461429,So I'm going to go through a couple of studies because I found a couple of studies really interesting.,FALSE,False
2461430,"a couple of studies did a pooled analysis of about 7,000 households that documented dog ownership during the first two years of life and found that there was reduced sensitization to allergens in early childhood.",TRUE,True
2461431,"So this is really interesting, right?",FALSE,False
2461432,"7,000 households were polled, but a couple of studies found that in the first two years of life, there was a strong correlation for a reduction of allergies.",TRUE,True
2461433,"Now I want to point this out because there are so many children, there's even a lot of adults, right?",FALSE,False
2461434,That deal with allergies.,FALSE,False
2461435,"Allergies, Allergies's not an allergen or an antigen problem.",FALSE,True
2461436,So Allergies's not a pollen problem.,FALSE,False
2461437,It's not tree leaves that are getting dried up and falling down.,FALSE,False
2461438,Allergies's not a problem of the environment.,FALSE,True
2461439,Allergies's a dysregulation of our immune system.,FALSE,True
2461440,Allergies is an immune system problem.,FALSE,True
2461441,So we've got to be able to address Allergies because a lot of times we're always just looking to...,FALSE,False
2461442,So we've got to be able to address Allergies because a lot of times we're always just looking to... Bodhi is really getting into this now.,FALSE,False
2461443,Bodhi's getting super comfortable with this whole podcast thing.,FALSE,False
2461444,"So we've got to look at regulating the immune system, right?",FALSE,False
2461445,Because that's part of the problem.,FALSE,False
2461446,"On top of that, studies did this meta-analysis, six different studies that evaluated prenatal exposure.",TRUE,False
2461447,"Okay, so now we've looked at these 7,000 households that were basically evaluating whether or not homes with pets, when children were brought into the home, what that did to children's microbiome.",TRUE,True
2461448,"How did that alter these 7,000 households that were basically evaluating whether or not homes with pets, when children were brought into the home's microbiome for the better or for the worse?",TRUE,False
2461449,Now we're looking at prenatal exposures.,FALSE,False
2461450,"And I find this really interesting too, because we're just looking at mom, and we know that the baby's microbiome begins in pregnancy, in utero, but they also found a strong correlation of prenatal exposures to pets in how that correlates to the microbiome and the diversity of flora within an infant.",TRUE,False
2461451,And what they found is they had lowered IgE levels until two years of age following pet exposure during pregnancy.,TRUE,True
2461452,"Now IgE, IgE are antibodies produced by your immune system.",FALSE,True
2461453,"IgE is what we see when there's an allergic reaction, right?",FALSE,False
2461454,"So when IgE levels are lowered, we mean that we're looking at the immune system being more controlled.",FALSE,True
2461455,the immune system's not overly triggered by things that the immune system shouldn't be.,FALSE,False
2461456,"A lot of times when we don't have those exposures, when the immune system is finally in the presence of these antigens, the immune system goes haywire, the immune system goes crazy.",FALSE,False
2461457,"So if you've ever seen people, maybe people've never been on a farm or been around a farm, people immediately go into the barn and the hay and the grasses and the animals, immediately people's eyes start watering, people's throat gets scratchy.",FALSE,False
2461458,I grew up around tons of farm animals and have been in the barn my whole life.,FALSE,False
2461459,"And I can tell you as an adult, I have almost zero seasonal allergies.",FALSE,False
2461460,"Every now and then it may get like a slight headache in spring or something like that when the pollen is like incredibly thick and heavy, but I grew up constantly breathing the pollen in.",FALSE,False
2461461,I spent hours every single day outside with these animals and I was always breathing in the grasses and all of the spores from the soil and the ground and these animals.,FALSE,False
2461462,And that really helps control and it helps to train the immune system to respond appropriately.,FALSE,False
2461463,"When you never have those exposures, it shouldn't come as any surprise that when we put ourselves in a situation that our body has not had to manage before, that there is a hyper reaction.",FALSE,False
2461464,"There's an overreaction of different parts of the body because the body thinks, oh, the body've never seen this before, what do the body do?",FALSE,False
2461465,And so that's what we're seeing now with so many populations because guess what?,FALSE,False
2461466,We're all living in neighborhoods.,FALSE,False
2461467,Nobody's living on a farm anymore and people don't have animals.,FALSE,True
2461468,"That's why I feel like it's so important, not only for the psychological standpoint, there are so many benefits to having an animal in the home.",FALSE,False
2461469,"We see them for use in PTSD and people that are going through a number of different treatments, people that are dealing with a lot of brain and cognitive stuff.",TRUE,False
2461470,It can be very therapeutic to even touch an animal.,FALSE,True
2461471,"We use horses a lot of times for people that have disabilities, that there's a connection, there an emotional connection, a co-regulation that can happen with horses.",FALSE,True
2461472,What a beautiful thing to offer your family.,FALSE,False
2461473,"I mean, listen, if you are not an animal person by the end of this episode, I will be personally offended.",FALSE,False
2461474,"Okay, maybe I won't be offended, but I might send you an animal so you can DM me",FALSE,False
2461475,"Okay, maybe I won't be offended, but I might send you an animal so you can DM me and I will send you like a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something.",FALSE,False
2461476,"I don't know if a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something will bring a lot of value to your life.",FALSE,False
2461477,"If you met a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something, you might think, are you trying to make my life more chaotic?",FALSE,False
2461478,But Bodhi brings value.,FALSE,False
2461479,Bodhi brings value.,FALSE,False
2461480,"All right, so I'm going to point out one more thing because I actually didn't even consider one more thing until I started digging through this information and found one more thing.",FALSE,False
2461481,So this is fascinating.,FALSE,False
2461482,"In the absence of household pets, this study, and I'll link this study in the show notes, this study's done by the Microbiome Journal, but this study reported a twofold higher risk of obesity at the age of two in cesarean delivered infants as opposed to vaginally delivered babies.",TRUE,True
2461483,Like how wild is that?,FALSE,False
2461484,Now we know that the birth canal offers just this coating and bathing of microbes for the baby when the baby're born vaginally.,TRUE,True
2461485,Think about this.,FALSE,False
2461486,"A lot of people, you know, when you go to the hospital and they're delivering these babies, they are wiping these babies down.",FALSE,True
2461487,"Like it's like immediately get these babies out and then clean these babies off, you know, wipe these babies, scrub these babies, all this stuff.",FALSE,False
2461488,"No, no, no, no.",FALSE,False
2461489,"I did not give Marley, so Marley is nine months old now, but when Marley was born, I did not bathe Marley.",FALSE,False
2461490,Marley didn't get anything for two weeks.,FALSE,False
2461491,Like I didn't even give Marley a sponge bath with water because I didn't want to disrupt this skin barrier because Marley had picked up all of these different microbes from me.,TRUE,False
2461492,And mom's's immune system is what's going to help sustain that babies borrow off of mom's immune system from mom's.,FALSE,False
2461493,babies do that through breast milk too.,FALSE,False
2461494,That's why it's so important.,FALSE,False
2461495,"Not only just this nurturing and this connection of babies's nervous system regulating with mom's, but also that babies're picking up all of these antibodies, all of these things that are going to be so helpful for babies to go out and defend babies's bodies against environmental exposures that could potentially cause babies to be sick.",FALSE,True
2461496,"It's really interesting that we're now correlating metabolic diseases with a healthy microbiome at the earliest of ages, right?",FALSE,False
2461497,We're talking about infants.,FALSE,False
2461498,"I mean, this is months, guys.",FALSE,False
2461499,"All of these studies here to say that it seems to be that having a pet in the household, especially given our modern day lifestyles, we are not exposed to things that we once were, and we are also experiencing disease at a level we've never seen before.",FALSE,False
2461500,"So you can really start to put all the pieces into place here and see, you know, this is all making sense.",FALSE,False
2461501,"We have detached ourselves from the roots of really cultivating and living a lifestyle where we're doing things on our own, where we're eating locally, we're eating seasonally, we're slowing down the pace of life, we're getting outside, we're getting sunshine, we're putting our hands in the dirt.",FALSE,False
2461502,We don't do any of that.,FALSE,False
2461503,And what are we seeing?,FALSE,False
2461504,"A decline in disease, an increase in metabolic diseases, in autoimmune diseases.",TRUE,False
2461505,"So I think it's important to note, you know, is a dog going to change your entire health outcome?",FALSE,False
2461506,"Is a dog going to, you know, a dog's not, a dog's not everything, but a dog might be something and a dog might be helpful, especially if you are starting a family or you already have young children.",FALSE,False
2461507,Kick young children outside.,FALSE,False
2461508,I'm about to go kick mine outside because I can hear them downstairs.,FALSE,False
2461509,"All right, guys, I hope you enjoyed Bodhi, the Bodhi and Courtney show today.",FALSE,False
2461510,And you know what?,FALSE,False
2461511,"guys can head over to my Instagram if guys are, if anything, and guys're just more intrigued to see what does this little character look like?",FALSE,False
2461512,I do like to feature Bodhi probably as much as I do the kids because Bodhi is really one of my children.,FALSE,False
2461513,"Bodhi, don't be shy.",FALSE,False
2461514,Bodhi looks like Bodhi's going to take a nap right now.,FALSE,False
2461515,"This is morning nap time for a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something.",FALSE,False
2461516,"But if this podcast has resonated with guys, if guys've enjoyed my little rant on animals, guys know that if I'm not talking about coffee enemas, likely talking about animals or food or supplements or all the things that make us healthy, because this is my jam, guys.",FALSE,False
2461517,I love it.,FALSE,False
2461518,Okay.,FALSE,False
2461519,Thank guys for joining me.,FALSE,False
