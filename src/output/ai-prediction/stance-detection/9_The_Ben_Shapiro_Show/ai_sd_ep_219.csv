The legislation is intended to help keep estranged young people housed, not remove children from parents. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Washington state lawmakers passed a bill that allows the state government to take children away from parents who refuse to consent to the child receiving gender-affirming care. THE FACTS: The legislation, Senate Bill 5599, is designed to ensure shelter for teenagers who are seeking reproductive health services or gender-affirming care and, for example, were kicked out by their parents. The Democrat-controlled Washington legislature has passed a bill to protect young people seeking reproductive or gender-affirming health services.

Another bill would prevent doctors from facing disciplinary consequences in Washington if they provide gender-affirming care in violation of other states' laws. Flashback: Two years ago, Washington's Democratic-controlled legislature passed a law that requires insurers to cover gender-affirming surgeries that are prescribed by a person's doctor and deemed medically necessary. A measure Liias is sponsoring this year would allow youth shelters in Washington to house young people who are seeking gender-affirming care, without having to notify or get permission from the children's parents. The goal is to provide ""stability and security"" for LGBTQ youths whose homes are not welcoming or safe places, Liias said during a recent Senate floor debate. The other side: Republicans opposed that bill, saying it would shut parents out of important parts of their children's lives. While politicians in some states are working to limit gender-affirming care for transgender young people, Washington state's legislature is going in the opposite direction. What's happening: This year, Washington lawmakers are trying to protect transgender patients — as well as doctors who practice here — from the reach of other states' laws that restrict gender-affirming health care for minors.

France does not have the ability to become an independent superpower.,"Reconciling that dilemma between independence and reliance has animated and bedeviled French strategy ever since World War II left most of Europe subjugated to foreign superpowers. Though Americans sometimes see French willfulness as animated by vanity or a desire to reclaim long-lost imperial pride, French leaders are keenly aware that they lead a medium-sized power in a world dominated by larger ones. The planned submarine sale follows a long line of moves calibrated to project French power, maintaining the country’s ability to steer its own fate, while aligning with the allies whose help Paris knows it needs, paradoxically, to stand on its own. For France, this week’s geopolitical drama — its nixed submarine sale to Australia, and its furious response to the United States’ jumping the deal — encapsulates a problem the once-mighty nation has struggled with for decades: how to assert itself as an independent power, which French leaders see as essential, while maintaining the alliances on which they know France relies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/world/europe/france-submarines-biden.html,REFUTES,REFUTES

This analysis replaces our earlier estimate, released immediately after Election Day, which estimated a 5 to 11 point increase in youth voter turnout compared to 2016 based on data available in that moment. Historically, youth ages 18-19 have voted at lower rates than their slightly older peers, and that was once again the case in 2020. However, some states managed to close the gap; in California and Washington, remarkably, voter turnout was actually higher among youth ages 18-19.

You're not allowed to wreck the tabernacle on the Jewish Sabbath.,"After the instructions for the Tabernacle are given and right before the actual construction of the Tabernacle begins, Moses gives an incongruous message commanding the Jews to rest on Shabbat (Exodus 35:1-3). In no fewer than 12 places, the Torah reiterates the prohibition against doing work, or in Hebrew melachah (Jewish sabbath rules), on Shabbat. But it is not clear from the Torah exactly which type of work is included in this prohibition. From this incongruous juxtaposition of Shabbat and the Tabernacle, the sages derive that the Tabernacle may not be constructed on Shabbat. This implies that any labor that was needed for the construction of the Tabernacle is considered melacha (labor) according to Jewish law and is therefore prohibited on Shabbat. This implies that any labor that was needed for the construction of the Tabernacle is considered melacha (labor) according to Jewish law and is therefore prohibited on Shabbat. ... Why does the Torah place the commandment to cease work on Shabbat next to the work of the Tabernacle? In the language of the Mishna, there are 40 minus one melachot that are forbidden on Shabbat. Though no source is given for this exact number, some commentaries have noted that there are 39 vessels, materials, and garments listed as necessary for the Tabernacle (Exodus 35).",https://theisraelbible.com/the-39-acts-forbidden-on-the-sabbath/,REFUTES,REFUTES
You're not allowed to wreck the tabernacle on the Jewish Sabbath.,"People often incorrectly think that the prohibitions in force on Jews on the Sabbath have to do with not 'working'. This is not exactly correct. One may hear people say that ""in the old days"" it was a lot of work to make a fire (and thus light) but now all we have to do is flip a switch, so now it is not work and is ok to do. This incorrect thinking is applied to many of the other Sabbath prohibitions. The fact is that the the type of 'work' that is prohibited, as someone stated above, is based on the 39 categories of creative activities that were done in the construction of the 'Mishkan', i.e. the Tabernacle (portable 'Temple') that was constucted when the Jews were in the desert after the exodus from Egypt. Those construction activities were halted for the Sabbath. The whole basis of 'resting' on the Sabbath is because G-d 'rested' on the 7th day after the 6 days of creation. Now we know that after those 6 days of creation G-d did NOT say ""Wow, I am exhausted! I need to rest!"" What that 'rest' means is that He stopped doing creative activity. In like manner he commanded the Jewish people to cease from doing creative activities on the Sabbath. This serves as reminder every week as to WHO it is that created the world we live in and who is truly in control of it. It gives a chance to reflect about the greatness of G-d and all He has given us, and about the limited creative powers that we do have because HE gave us those abilities to use to serve HIM.",https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8854/is-it-okay-to-drive-a-car-on-the-sabbath,REFUTES,REFUTES
