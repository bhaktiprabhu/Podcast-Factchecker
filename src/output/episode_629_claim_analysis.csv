2458619,Welcome to The Doctor's Pharmacy.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458620,I'm Dr. Mark Hyman.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458621,That's pharmacy with an F in place for conversations that matter.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458622,"Today, I'm bringing you a health bite to improve your health because taking small steps every day can lead to significant change over time.",Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458623,"Today, we're going to talk about sleep and not just sleep problems in general, but why we may wake up between 1 and 4 in the morning and how you can fix that because a lot of times people have restless sleep.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458624,They wake up at night.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458625,"They can't go back to sleep and it really affects the quality of their health, their life and everything else.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458626,"Sleep is critical to our health, to longevity, to our mental health, to basically every physiological function we have and it really is important to fix it.",Not Checkworthy,3,0,Checkworthy,False
2458627,Let's talk about what you can do to stay asleep and to sleep more deeply.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458628,"So, we know that poor sleep makes us less productive, it makes us tired, hard to focus.",Not Checkworthy,3,0,Checkworthy,False
2458629,"Basically, having sleep deprivation is basically equivalent to being drunk.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458630,"In terms of your performance, you know, I read a study once where they were snipers who were, you know, excellent shots and if they had 8 hours sleep, they were like 100% accurate.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2458631,"If they had 7 hours sleep, they were like 95% accurate.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458632,"If they had 6 hours sleep, they were like 70% accurate and if they were like less than 6 hours sleep, they were basically like 50%, it's like almost a hit and miss.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458633,"So, not good even when you're an expert in something, you can't function when you're tired.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458634,"So, next to sort of nutrition, exercise and maybe even before it, some would argue sleep may be the fundamental foundation of health and disease prevention and even weight control.",Not Checkworthy,3,0,Checkworthy,False
2458635,So why is it so important?,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458636,How does sleep dysfunction lead to changes?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458637,"Well, there's a very important hormone called cortisol which is your stress hormone and it helps when it's imbalanced to go up in the morning to get you energetic and focused and do the things you need to do for the day and at night, it's supposed to go down and you're supposed to calm down and relax.",Not Checkworthy,3,0,Checkworthy,False
2458638,"Now, a lot of people have an inversion where their cortisol is all in the morning, they can't get out of bed and at night, they're tired and wired.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458639,Sound familiar?,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458640,I bet you some big experience that I certainly have at different moments in my life.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458641,"When you lay and get down in bed, you're exhausted but you can't fall asleep because you're just wired.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458642,"It has to do with your adrenal glands and they're designed to keep things in balance to regulate your weight, to moderate your stress response, to control blood sugar, regulate inflammation and regulate sleep and wake cycles.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458643,"So when we're constantly in a state of stress, we're actually often struggling with sleep because of the way in which it affects our sleep.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458644,"So when you think about it, when your cortisol is high, you're running from a tiger, you're in danger.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458645,You don't want to be sleeping.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458646,You want to be alert and that's the problem.,Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458647,"So if your cortisol levels are balanced and they're high in the morning and then low at night and your blood sugar stays even, we'll talk about why that's important because fluctuations in blood sugar often will cause midnight or middle of the night wakening.",Not Checkworthy,3,0,Checkworthy,False
2458648,"But when your cortisol and your body stress response are balanced and your pineal gland produces something called melatonin that pulses really strong in the afternoon and the evening, which gets you ready for sleep and lets your cortisol drop off and then you can feel calm and go to sleep at night and feel sleepy.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458649,"And if you're healthy and balanced in your circadian rhythms and your cortisol and melatonin cycles, you'll be fine.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458650,"But if your cortisol is high in the afternoon or high in the evening, you might feel tired and wired.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458651,"You want to sleep, but you can't.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458652,Or you might fall asleep because you're really tired,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458653,"and then you wake up in the middle of the night, like between one and four.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458654,"And that happens when you sort of go, go, go, go, go, do your email, you're working, working, working and busy and then you go to bed and you fall asleep because you're exhausted but you end up waking up because your body is still in a stress state.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458655,There's still high levels of cortisol.,Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2458656,So how does stress affect your sleep-wake cycles?,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458657,"Well, it works in a lot of different ways.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458658,"Psychological stress can be a big factor, right?",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458659,"Worries about family, work, money, physical stresses, lack of exercise is a stress, believe it or not.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458660,"Too much screen time, junk food, toxic lifestyles, hormonal imbalances, environmental toxins.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458661,"All these drive increased inflammation, increased brain inflammation, and also increased cortisol.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458662,"Because by the way, do you know this, that when you eat sugar or starch, your body responds by jerking up the adrenaline and cortisol levels.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458663,So literally eating sugar is a stressful experience to your body.,Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458664,"Even if you're getting pleasure and you don't think it's stressful and you're meditating while you're eating sugar, you're still going to have high cortisol and high adrenaline.",Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458665,So what are the things that are the two most common things that are screwing up your sleep-wake cycles?,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458666,It's probably blood sugar imbalances and spikes and crashes in blood sugar and chronic stress.,Not Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,False
2458667,So what should you do to optimize nutrition so you can regulate your stress hormones through food and lifestyle and how do you deal with actually regulating sleep throughout the whole night and get high quality sleep?,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458668,"So first thing is our bodies, whether we like it or not, are biological organisms and they run in circadian rhythms and they need to be balanced.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458669,So you have to live in rhythm.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458670,I experienced the dangers of not being in rhythm when I worked in the emergency room.,Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2458671,I would sometimes work at 7 in the morning until 5 at night shift.,Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2458672,Then I'd work at 2 in the afternoon until the 2 in the morning shift.,Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2458673,Then I'd work at 11 o'clock at night to a 7 in the morning shift.,Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,False
2458674,"Then I'd work at 8 in the morning to an 8 in the morning shift, 24 hour shift.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2458675,I was all over the place and my whole system became dysregulated and ultimately it led to chronic fatigue syndrome and a bunch of other stuff.,Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2458676,My system just kind of collapsed because I was pushing through all these circadian rhythms which have to be in balance for you to be healthy.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458677,"And whether we like it or not, we tend to do a lot better from our health perspective if we go to bed at the same time, if we wake at the same time, if we eat at the same time.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458678,Our bodies are designed like that.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458679,So you want to make sure that you actually don't eat before bed because that's the worst thing you can do.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458680,But you need to make sure you're having meals in a regular time space.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458681,So don't eat three hours before bed.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458682,Don't eat a heavy meal before bed because I guarantee you that'll screw up your sleep.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458683,"Also carbohydrates, I think if you want to actually eat some starchy things like sweet potatoes or some more starchy foods and you can handle it metabolically, make sure you do it at night because the serotonin levels go up and it helps with sleep when you have your carbohydrates.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458684,"But still don't eat white flour, sugar, processed, all that processed food.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458685,Also not eating enough is stressful.,Not Checkworthy,1,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458686,"If your body's not getting enough food, it's also considered a stress.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458687,Now you can do time-restricted eating and you can sort of narrow the window in which you eat for longevity purposes and so on.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458688,But you also want to make sure you're getting enough food and not actually starving because that will increase cortisol and you'll wake in the middle of the night.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458689,"Now if you want to lose weight, you can use what I think is probably the most effective treatment I've ever found, which is the 10-Day Detox Diet.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458690,"It helped people lose 120, 130, 200 pounds.",Checkworthy,2,1,Checkworthy,True
2458691,It's like a gastric bypass without the pain of surgery vomiting and malnutrition.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458692,Another thing you can do is get stuff out of your head.,Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458693,"Write your worries down at night, so get a little piece of paper or journal or maybe in your phone.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458694,"Write down all your worries, what you have to do, your day should be organized for the next day.",Not Checkworthy,0,3,Not Checkworthy,True
2458695,Free up your mind so you can actually let go of things and go into a deep restful sleep.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458696,"Next, you can try a number of supplements and things that I found very helpful.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2458697,Magnesium is super important.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2458698,It's the relaxation mineral.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2458699,"It helps regulate the stress response, helps regulate cortisol, helps relax your muscles.",Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458700,"I recommend 200 to 400, even more of magnesium glycinate before bed.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2458701,"Glycine also helps with sleep, so you can use glycine and you can use that to help relax the nervous system and your muscles.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458702,"Next, try some melatonin.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458703,Mellow out with a little melatonin.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458704,"You can use half to up to two to three milligrams of melatonin at night and that can often help you reset your circadian rhythms, particularly with travel.",Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,True
2458705,Also ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb that can be really powerful for resetting cortisol.,Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,True
2458706,"I use a product called Cortisol Manager, which helps at night to reduce the stress response and improve sleep quality.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2458707,"Also make sure, as I said, to get in rhythm, where you can sleep at the same time.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458708,Try to go to sleep before 10.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458709,"That's the best sleep you can have is before midnight, believe it or not.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458710,"So get in bed by 10, try to be asleep shortly thereafter, 11 at the latest, and try to wake up at the same time every day.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458711,Also make your bedroom completely sleep supportive.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458712,"For example, make sure you have eye shades or blackout shades on your windows or eye shades on your eyes, earplugs if it's noisy.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458713,Make sure you really take care of creating a carefully controlled environment.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458714,Next is caffeine.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458715,"You know, some of us tolerate it okay and metabolize it, others don't.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458716,"So I encourage you to sort of maybe stop after breakfast, coffee, don't have coffee throughout the day.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458717,That's particularly important.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458718,"If you're still struggling, I would probably just stop coffee and caffeine altogether.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2458719,Alcohol definitely screws up sleep.,Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458720,"So if you want to sleep well and you're not sleeping well, quit alcohol.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458721,Just get off it.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458722,It can interrupt sleep.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458723,It creates poor sleep quality.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458724,Also sunlight is a basic great medicine.,Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458725,You know what I mean?,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458726,"Sunlight, I'm going to go to sleep.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2458727,"No, but 20 minutes of sunlight in the morning without sunglasses on, outdoors, not behind a window has a big effect on your circadian rhythm.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458728,So we are a photobiomodulating organisms.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458729,"The light affects us, it regulates our biology.",Not Checkworthy,2,0,Checkworthy,False
2458730,And it's important to make sure you have a good 20 minutes of light exposure in the morning.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458731,So those are some simple tips that you can do to help sleep issues.,Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
2458732,"Often by the way at night, if you're having a crash and hot flashes at night and night sweats that can often be low sugar.",Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458733,And so that's really important to balance your insulin and blood sugar.,Not Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,True
2458734,"And I've written a lot about that, like the 10 Day Detox Diet is a great way to do that.",Checkworthy,0,2,Not Checkworthy,False
2458735,"Now, if you're still having trouble sleeping, there are many other reasons.",Not Checkworthy,1,1,Checkworthy,False
