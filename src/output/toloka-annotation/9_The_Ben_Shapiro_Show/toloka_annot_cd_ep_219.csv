2290763,"So what that means is that when we were trying to figure out what exactly you can and cannot do on the Jewish Sabbath, what we do is what we do.",0,0,
2290764,"We look at the so-called 39 malachot, right?",0,0,
2290765,39 activities.,0,0,
2290766,And 39 activities are things that you couldn't do in building the tabernacle.,0,0,
2290767,"And so the idea is that you're not allowed to do 39 activities when you are on a normal Sabbath, because that's the way we're learning what you can do and what you can't do when it comes to the Jewish Sabbath.",0,0,
2290768,And the commandment to keep the Jewish Sabbath is given in Exodus or to guard the Jewish Sabbath is given in Exodus.,0,0,
2290769,And so we're taking the book of Exodus and we're figuring out exactly what that means.,0,0,
2290770,So those rules include things ranging from digging to kindling a fire.,0,0,
2290771,So there's a big sort of early 20th century debate about the use of electricity.,0,0,
2290772,Is electricity the equivalent of kindling a fire?,0,0,
2290773,"Therefore, you're not allowed to actually turn on and off lights.",0,0,
2290774,"So you can actually preset lights on the Jewish Sabbath, right?",0,0,
2290775,You set it before the Jewish Sabbath and it goes on and off automatically.,0,0,
2290776,"You're not actually doing that, right?",0,0,
2290777,That would be one way of doing it.,0,0,
2290778,You can leave lights on throughout the Jewish Sabbath.,0,0,
2290779,You can't flip lights off because that's like putting out a fire.,0,0,
2290780,You're not allowed to do that on the Jewish Sabbath.,0,0,
2290781,The other theory with regard to electricity is that you're not allowed to build on the Jewish Sabbath.,0,0,
2290782,"And there's a piece of abstruse reasoning that says that this is a form of, in Hebrew, it's called bonah, of building.",0,0,
2290783,"And when you complete a circuit, that is a form of building.",0,0,
2290784,So that is the reason for that.,0,0,
2290785,"When it comes to driving a car, you're actively kindling a fire.",0,0,
2290786,"When you use an internal combustion engine, you're kindling a fire.",0,0,
2290787,"Now, when it comes to electric cars, you run into the same issues as with the light.",0,0,
2290788,"Is this the equivalent of either a shreit fire or is it the equivalent of bonah, like building a circuit?",0,0,
2290789,"Again, Jewish law is an attempt to reify in the world what God wants of you.",0,0,
2290790,And Jewish law gets into really kind of nook and cranny areas of tremendous specificity.,0,0,
2290791,"And it sounds wild, but the reality is that if you actually think that God cares about what you do, you try to suss out as best you can from the rules that are available to you how exactly to act in your daily life.",0,0,
2290792,So those are the reasons for that.,0,0,
2290793,"Mike Palmer says, Mike Palmer watch your show just about every day.",0,0,

2290797,"Everyone who uses the word anti-Semitic seems to pronounce the word anti-Semitic anti-Semitic, but the word anti-Semitic's clearly anti-Semitic.",0,0,
2290798,"Mike Palmer've even looked up the actual pronunciation, which is anti-Semitic.",0,0,
2290799,Mike Palmer've never heard anyone actually pronounce the word anti-Semitic as the word anti-Semitic's spelled.,0,0,
2290800,"Now, it will bother you.",0,0,

2290805,I don't know.,0,0,
2290806,I think the word anti-Semitic is out of date anyway.,0,0,
2290807,Mike Palmer think we should just use the term Jew hatred.,0,0,
2290808,So the term Jew hatred's what it is.,0,0,
2290809,"Matt says, hey, Ben, long time listener.",0,0,

2290828,Swinging the baby.,0,0,
2290829,That doesn't mean like you grab the baby by the feet.,0,0,
2290830,So it means that you like swing the baby side to side.,0,0,
2290831,the baby really like that.,0,0,
2290832,That's why babies like the baby swings.,0,0,
2290833,And you give babies like a pacifier.,0,0,
