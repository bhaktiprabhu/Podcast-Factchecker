2465329,I'm adding turmeric.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True

2465331,"Okay, I think the onions are looking rather golden now and time to add in the turmeric powder.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465332,"Wow, it's got a wonderfully bright colour and quite a strong aroma as well.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465333,"Now, turmeric is a close relative of ginger and if you buy it fresh, it has a similar knobbly, root-like look, but inside it's this vibrant yellow-orange.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465334,The colour comes from a substance within it called curcumin and that's the compound scientists think is the key to turmeric's benefits for the brain and body.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465335,"Turmeric has been widely used for millennia in many parts of the world, especially in Southeast Asia, not just for cooking but also as medicine and there is new research showing it could be especially beneficial for some types of pain.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True

2465339,Hi there.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465340,Hello.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465341,"Now, first of all, do you enjoy cooking?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465342,I do enjoy cooking,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465343,but I wish I had a bit more time to try different recipes.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465344,"Right, and have you ever cooked with turmeric before?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465345,I haven't actually.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465346,I've been wanting to incorporate more spices in my cooking.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465347,"Turmeric, as you may well know, is widely used in curries",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465348,"but it's also delicious in scrambled eggs, soups and yogurts or a turmeric pancake.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465349,"What I want you to do is to add one teaspoon a day to your cooking, could be breakfast, lunch or supper, however you want to do it, but one teaspoon a day.",Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465350,Do you think you can manage that?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465351,That sounds okay.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465352,"Yeah, I'm definitely up for giving it a go.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465353,Be aware that it is a very bright yellow colour and it can stain.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465354,That sounds good.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465355,Thanks for the heads up.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465356,"I've asked Yushi to spice things up with turmeric because this golden-hued powder not only adds colour and flavouring to food, it's also been linked to some surprising health claims, from boosting attention and working memory to improving asthma and eczema.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465357,The link between turmeric and health is nothing new.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465358,It's been used in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years to alleviate liver problems and digestive ailments.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465359,"Over the last couple of decades or so, scientific research into turmeric and in particular into its active ingredient curcumin has exploded, with lots of studies exploring the health effects of this golden spice.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465360,And some of the findings have been impressive.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465361,Let's start with the brain.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465362,"A Singaporean study in 2022, following 2,700 older people for nearly five years, found those who ate a lot of turmeric-rich curries, like korma, kept their brains in better shape, when measured for things like working memory and problem-solving, than those who didn't.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465363,"The authors suggest that it's the curcumin, which is a polyphenol in the turmeric, which is responsible for these positive effects.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465364,"Now, a big problem with curcumin is that normally very little of it gets absorbed.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465365,"So the scientists think that one of the reasons why they saw such good results in their study is because when you consume curcumin with fat and certain spices, this helps your body to absorb more of it.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465366,It's a great excuse to add it to curry.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465367,"And if you don't fancy curry, then you might consider a curcumin supplement.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465368,"In an Australian study where they gave curcumin in pill form to 80 older individuals, they found that compared to placebo, taking the supplements improved working memory and reduced fatigue.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465369,One way it might be working is by reducing inflammation.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465370,"In a recent Japanese study where overweight but otherwise healthy participants were randomly allocated to placebo or curcumin extract, they found those taking the supplements had lower levels of an inflammatory marker in the blood called C-reactive protein.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465371,"And as we'll discover in a moment, it appears turmeric can also relieve pain.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465372,I'll be delving into that with an expert shortly.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465373,"But first, let's check in with Yushi.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465374,The first recipe I tried was the chicken korma and the taste was really good overall.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465375,It was a nice bright yellow colour.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465376,It did stain things.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465377,The wooden spoon that I use for cooking is now just permanently yellow.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465378,The challenges really inspired me to be a bit more adventurous with the food that I make.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465379,I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465380,We'll catch up with Yushi at the end of the week and see if she can find some tasty ways to incorporate turmeric into her diet.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465381,"But now to get the lowdown on turmeric, I'm speaking to Dr Benny Antony from the Menzies Institute of Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465382,G'day.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465383,"Good day, Michael.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465384,"Now, what would you say are the main benefits of turmeric?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465385,"Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, that is a traditional Indian medicine, as well as traditional Chinese medicine.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465386,"But only recently, people have identified the active components such as the curcumin.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465387,So turmeric has been mainly known as an anti-inflammatory agent.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465388,It is also known to be an antioxidant.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465389,"Therefore, it can be useful for chronic conditions.",Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465390,It's also got antifungal properties and some wound healing properties.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465391,So what not?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465392,It's got many properties.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465393,"Now, I know you have done clinical trials looking at the benefits of using turmeric in arthritis.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465394,Can you tell me about that?,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465395,So this clinical trial involved 70 patients.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465396,So we selected patients based on pain as well as based on the joint inflammation.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465397,So we randomized 35 people into placebo group and 35 people into the active group who received the turmeric extract.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465398,And then we followed these patients over 12 weeks.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465399,And we found that the participants who were taking the turmeric extracts had relief in pain compared to the placebo group.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465400,"Obviously, both placebo and treatment group both reduced the knee pain.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465401,But the treatment group had a further reduction compared to placebo group.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465402,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465403,"Because we know the placebo effect is very powerful, particularly in pain.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465404,"So oddly enough, you would actually have to be quite impressive to outdo the placebo in this context.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465405,And did it affect the amount of pain medication they were taking?,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465406,"Yeah, that's one of the interesting or secondary outcomes of this trial was that there was a reduction in the number of medications which they were taking for their knee pain.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465407,So how does turmeric compare to a standard painkiller like ibuprofen?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465408,"In our trial, we did not really compare turmeric extract with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.",Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465409,"However, we can indirectly compare the effect size of the treatment.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465410,That means we found a modest effect of the treatment compared to placebo.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465411,"And similarly, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen have got only a modest effect.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465412,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as the ibuprofen seems to have a lot of contraindications.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465413,That means they cannot be taken in older patients.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465414,And a lot of these drugs have more severe adverse events such as the gastrointestinal bleeding or cardiovascular events.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465415,"So compared to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, there seems to be no adverse event for turmeric extract.",Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465416,Right.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465417,Did you also see an anti-inflammatory effect?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465418,Did they actually have less inflammation in the joint?,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465419,We did not find a significant difference in local inflammation.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465420,And we also tested whether the turmeric consumption led to a reduction in the inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465421,And we did not find a significant effect of these biomarkers.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465422,Because of the treatment of turmeric.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465423,So it's possible there is something else going on.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465424,That turmeric is not necessarily acting by reducing inflammation.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465425,What do you think that something else might be?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465426,So there is possibly other mechanisms that could have explained the reduction in pain.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465427,Some studies suggest that turmeric might have an effect in the gut-brain axis that turmeric extracts.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465428,Especially the curcumin can actually improve a certain type of bacterial colony which reduces the inflammation.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465429,So there is plenty of other evidence to say that turmeric can reduce inflammation in a systemic level and which is evidenced in the biomarkers as well.,Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,True
2465430,OK.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465431,Now you are obviously focusing on osteoarthritis which is an inflammatory condition in the knee.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465432,Do you think it could be beneficial for other types of pain?,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465433,So what we have found that it's been effective for acute pain as well.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465434,It's not just for the chronic conditions as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465435,But it's for normal healthy people.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465436,It can be used to reduce the pain.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465437,Although it still needs more research in this area.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465438,"If people do want to boost their turmeric consumption, what's the best way of doing so?",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465439,So if people want to increase the active component in the turmeric such as the curcumin in their body.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465440,The best way to do it is to combine it with some pepper because piperine seems to increase the bioavailability that means the increased absorption of curcumin in the body.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465441,The other option is fatty food seems to increase the bioavailability of curcumin.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465442,Obviously I've got an Indian heritage so I follow some of the Indian cuisine.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465443,So I pour oil first and then I put turmeric powder in it.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465444,So it's good for taste and it's going to increase the bioavailability.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465445,"Right, that's the science.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465446,Now let's check in one more time with Yushi to see how she's getting on with turmeric.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465447,It's the end of the week.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465448,The turmeric ended up tasting a lot nicer than I expected.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465449,And I surprised myself with the range of different dishes I was able to incorporate turmeric into.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465450,The turmeric pancakes were really delicious.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465451,The turmeric gave the pancakes a really warm flavour.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465452,It worked quite well with savoury toppings.,Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,False
2465453,I'll definitely be making the curry again.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465459,Nice and frost up.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465460,I'm adding a nice teaspoon of turmeric and then giving it a good old stir.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465461,And it's certainly a wonderfully orange colour.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465462,And the advantage of using milk is the fat means that I'm going to absorb more of the good stuff as well.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465463,It's also delicious.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465464,"So if you're looking for an excuse to have a delicious hot drink or perhaps that curry you've been craving, here it is.",Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465465,Add in some turmeric.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465466,It could boost your brain and take away your pain.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
2465467,So that's it.,Not Checkworthy,0,1,Not Checkworthy,True
2465468,It's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine which really could benefit your body and life.,Not Checkworthy,1,0,Checkworthy,False
