2461334,"I'm your host, Courtney Versage, along with Dr. Josh Axe and Dr. Chris Motley.",0,0,
2461335,We're so happy you've joined us.,0,0,
2461336,Let's dive into today's episode.,0,0,
2461337,"Hey, everybody.",0,0,
2461338,Welcome back.,0,0,
2461339,"the Ancient Health Podcast, where we educate you on real health solutions that will help transform the way you live, feel, and overcome disease naturally is the Ancient Health Podcast.",0,0,
2461340,"My name is Courtney, and I'm so glad that you've joined me today's.",0,0,
2461341,"I have to be honest, I have a special guest in the studio with me today's.",0,0,
2461342,today's episode is a special guest's first podcast.,0,0,
2461343,a special guest might be a little bit nervous.,0,0,
2461344,"So far, a special guest has tried to escape two different times, and a special guest's being forced against a special guest's will to join me.",0,0,
2461345,a special guest is not actually a human guest.,0,0,
2461346,a special guest is Bodhi.,0,0,
2461347,I would say that a special guest's a dog.,0,0,
2461348,"Maybe by genetics, a special guest is a dog.",0,0,
2461349,"But if you're needing a visual, a special guest is somewhat of a combination of the squirrel from Ice Age.",0,0,
2461350,You know the one with the big eyes that's always running around with the nut that the squirrel from Ice Age carries around?,0,0,
2461351,a special guest's kind of like half the squirrel from Ice Age.,0,0,
2461352,"And then if you are familiar, if you have kids and you know the movie, Lilo and Stitch, a special guest is Stitch, kind of crazy, also big eyes, kind of a big head, big ears.",0,0,
2461353,"So if you're walking, if you're out listening to this, you cannot see a special guest, that's kind of a good visual for you.",0,0,
2461354,So a special guest's quite the character.,0,0,
2461355,"But I bring a special guest on today's not because Dr. Motley is unavailable to join me for today's episode and he's the stand-in, but because we're actually talking about our pets.",0,0,
2461356,"We're going to talk about how dogs, specifically cats, dogs, specifically cats kind of fit the bill too.",0,0,
2461357,But some of the data that we're going to look at really looks at the influence of dogs in the house on our microbiome.,0,0,
2461358,And what's interesting is that animals really have always lived with humans.,0,0,
2461359,"Up until this really industrialized age, we've always cohabitated because we've relied on animals for...",0,0,
2461360,"Yeah, a special guest.",0,0,
2461361,Okay.,0,0,
2461362,a special guest's so excited to be here.,0,0,
2461363,I'm glad a special guest finally spoke up.,0,0,
2461364,a special guest's a little shy.,0,0,
2461365,But we've always grown up with animals because animals have been a part of how we live.,0,0,
2461366,"We utilize animals for food, we utilize animals to help manage crops, to ultimately regenerate our soil.",0,0,
2461367,"There's so many purposes for animals beyond just animals's companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too.",0,0,
2461368,"And today's episode, we're not going to talk about so many purposes for animals beyond just their companionship, which is a great benefit to our health too specifically, maybe we'll do another one.",0,0,
2461369,But what I want to focus on is how pets can influence your microbiome because pets bring so much to the table.,0,0,
2461370,"If you think about our animals, our animals're actually out making contact with the dirt and the soil and our animals're bringing the dirt and the soil into our house.",0,0,
2461371,"So animals are bringing things in from the outdoors, things that we normally wouldn't be probably exposed to.",0,0,
2461372,Most of us aren't running around our yard and putting our hands in the dirt.,0,0,
2461373,We're not really even grounding.,0,0,
2461374,We're just inside these sterile environments.,0,0,
2461375,We're not getting access to nature.,0,0,
2461376,And animals actually bring a lot of nature into our homes.,0,0,
2461377,But a lot of the studies that have been done on the influence of dogs on our health really relate to children.,0,0,
2461378,"And I found this so fascinating because there are a lot of people that maybe have kids and they also have pets or maybe think that, hey, pets might be a problem for my child.",0,0,
2461379,What if my dog gets my child sick?,0,0,
2461380,What if my cat gets my child sick?,0,0,
2461381,"And yes, you're exactly right to have concern because animals do have the ability to carry parasites and worms and things like parasites and worms.",0,0,
2461382,But what you've got to realize too is that animals bring a lot of microbial diversity.,0,0,
2461383,And a lot of microbial diversity's something that your child can share from.,0,0,
2461384,"Because in those early years, the first years, we're talking from infancy and birth all the way up to the first two and three years, their microbiome is heavily influenced by the environment that they're raised in.",0,0,
2461385,And so I want to bring to light a couple of things.,0,0,
2461386,"This might be something to consider, especially if maybe you're starting a family, maybe you have children, maybe you have a spouse that doesn't love animals.",0,0,
2461387,"I'm not going to say that a special guest is unloved in this house, but I can tell you that a special guest has more love from some of us than a special guest does others.",0,0,
2461388,"a special guest's also, okay, just a side note, a special guest is like one and a half years old.",0,0,
2461389,a special guest's completely untrained.,0,0,
2461390,"a special guest doesn't know a single command, and a special guest pretty much does whatever a special guest wants.",0,0,
2461391,So I'm okay with it.,0,0,
2461392,I have all the love in the world for Bodhi.,0,0,
2461393,Bodhi's like my sidekick.,0,0,
2461394,"However, not everybody feels the same way about Bodhi, including other family members.",0,0,
2461395,"Bodhi gets love from me, but I feel like that's enough.",0,0,
2461396,And Bodhi and I have a very strong bond and relationship.,0,0,
2461397,"So all right, Bodhi, do Bodhi feel good about that?",0,0,
2461398,"Okay, so let's get into the data.",0,0,
2461399,"So when we're talking about infants and babies, the microbial composition is shaped by a number of factors.",0,0,
2461400,"And a number of factors includes gestational age, the type of delivery that infants and babies had, so whether infants and babies were born vaginally or cesarean, and then the type of diet.",0,0,
2461401,"So if you think about, are infants and babies breastfed or are infants and babies formula fed?",0,0,
2461402,"And even if infants and babies've been exposed to antibiotics, because we have a number of children and children get sick in those first few months of life, and all of a sudden it's one antibiotic after another, which is just wiping out children's gut microbiome.",0,0,
2461403,So microbial composition in infants is actually very low in terms of diversity.,0,0,
2461404,"So it's so critical in those first few months of life that infants get flooded with these good bacteria, these good microbes to help build some resiliency because infants's immune system depends on it.",0,0,
2461405,"And even beyond that, infants's brain health, infants's hormones, like all of these things are the linchpin is infants's gut.",0,0,
2461406,"I mean, Hippocrates says all disease begins in the gut.",0,0,
2461407,And that's so true because the gut is the cornerstone element.,0,0,
2461408,"If your gut health is not intact, if your gut health is not resilient and strong, you are going to suffer in so many downstream ways.",0,0,
2461409,So there was this thing called the hygiene hypothesis.,0,0,
2461410,this thing called the hygiene hypothesis was first brought up in the late like 1980s.,0,0,
2461411,"And there were a bunch of epidemiological studies that were done that attribute the risk of allergic disease to overly hygienic environments, which this makes sense, right?",0,0,
2461412,"If you think about any newborn child being brought into a home, any newborn child're not going outside.",0,0,
2461413,any newborn child're not getting exposed to a lot of different things in the environment.,0,0,
2461414,And our homes have become increasingly sterilized.,0,0,
2461415,We have all these cleaning chemicals.,0,0,
2461416,"We have chemicals that are on our furniture, that are in the paint on the walls.",0,0,
2461417,"All of these things contribute to toxins, which toxins can modulate.",0,0,
2461418,Toxins can change the microbiome.,0,0,
2461419,So this thing called the hygiene hypothesis was first proposed in the late like 1980s.,0,0,
2461420,"And the idea is that as we become more sterilized in our homes and in our just overall environment, the risk of disease has actually increased.",0,0,
2461421,There's further evidence that gut microbial dysbiosis during infancy is associated with the development of allergic disease specifically.,0,0,
2461422,"And this is really because after a child is born, a lot of times a child are exposed to nothing but just the inside of a child's homes, right?",0,0,
2461423,"Because a lot of infants, I mean, granted, mom might be outside taking mom's baby for a walk, but for the most part, a lot of infants are only exposed to the things that are indoors.",0,0,
2461424,"And our indoor living environment has been proved to be far more toxic, including the air that we're breathing, right?",0,0,
2461425,"Because of all the off-gassing, so many different things that are in our homes.",0,0,
2461426,"On top of that, we have all of these different cleaning agents, these cleaning chemicals that are disrupting a lot of flora inside our homes.",0,0,
2461427,"So despite rapid microbial colonization of the gut after birth, environmental microbes in the early postnatal period represent a critical exposure for early life immune programming.",0,0,
2461428,And we find that this can have long-term consequences.,0,0,
2461429,So I'm going to go through a couple of studies because I found a couple of studies really interesting.,0,0,
2461430,"a couple of studies did a pooled analysis of about 7,000 households that documented dog ownership during the first two years of life and found that there was reduced sensitization to allergens in early childhood.",0,0,
2461431,"So this is really interesting, right?",0,0,
2461432,"7,000 households were polled, but a couple of studies found that in the first two years of life, there was a strong correlation for a reduction of allergies.",0,0,
2461433,"Now I want to point this out because there are so many children, there's even a lot of adults, right?",0,0,
2461434,That deal with allergies.,0,0,
2461435,"Allergies, Allergies's not an allergen or an antigen problem.",0,0,
2461436,So Allergies's not a pollen problem.,0,0,
2461437,It's not tree leaves that are getting dried up and falling down.,0,0,
2461438,Allergies's not a problem of the environment.,0,0,
2461439,Allergies's a dysregulation of our immune system.,0,0,
2461440,Allergies is an immune system problem.,0,0,
2461441,So we've got to be able to address Allergies because a lot of times we're always just looking to...,0,0,
2461442,So we've got to be able to address Allergies because a lot of times we're always just looking to... Bodhi is really getting into this now.,0,0,
2461443,Bodhi's getting super comfortable with this whole podcast thing.,0,0,
2461444,"So we've got to look at regulating the immune system, right?",0,0,
2461445,Because that's part of the problem.,0,0,
2461446,"On top of that, studies did this meta-analysis, six different studies that evaluated prenatal exposure.",0,0,
2461447,"Okay, so now we've looked at these 7,000 households that were basically evaluating whether or not homes with pets, when children were brought into the home, what that did to children's microbiome.",0,0,
2461448,"How did that alter these 7,000 households that were basically evaluating whether or not homes with pets, when children were brought into the home's microbiome for the better or for the worse?",0,0,
2461449,Now we're looking at prenatal exposures.,0,0,
2461450,"And I find this really interesting too, because we're just looking at mom, and we know that the baby's microbiome begins in pregnancy, in utero, but they also found a strong correlation of prenatal exposures to pets in how that correlates to the microbiome and the diversity of flora within an infant.",0,0,
2461451,And what they found is they had lowered IgE levels until two years of age following pet exposure during pregnancy.,0,0,
2461452,"Now IgE, IgE are antibodies produced by your immune system.",0,0,
2461453,"IgE is what we see when there's an allergic reaction, right?",0,0,
2461454,"So when IgE levels are lowered, we mean that we're looking at the immune system being more controlled.",0,0,
2461455,the immune system's not overly triggered by things that the immune system shouldn't be.,0,0,
2461456,"A lot of times when we don't have those exposures, when the immune system is finally in the presence of these antigens, the immune system goes haywire, the immune system goes crazy.",0,0,
2461457,"So if you've ever seen people, maybe people've never been on a farm or been around a farm, people immediately go into the barn and the hay and the grasses and the animals, immediately people's eyes start watering, people's throat gets scratchy.",0,0,
2461458,I grew up around tons of farm animals and have been in the barn my whole life.,0,0,
2461459,"And I can tell you as an adult, I have almost zero seasonal allergies.",0,0,
2461460,"Every now and then it may get like a slight headache in spring or something like that when the pollen is like incredibly thick and heavy, but I grew up constantly breathing the pollen in.",0,0,
2461461,I spent hours every single day outside with these animals and I was always breathing in the grasses and all of the spores from the soil and the ground and these animals.,0,0,
2461462,And that really helps control and it helps to train the immune system to respond appropriately.,0,0,
2461463,"When you never have those exposures, it shouldn't come as any surprise that when we put ourselves in a situation that our body has not had to manage before, that there is a hyper reaction.",0,0,
2461464,"There's an overreaction of different parts of the body because the body thinks, oh, the body've never seen this before, what do the body do?",0,0,
2461465,And so that's what we're seeing now with so many populations because guess what?,0,0,
2461466,We're all living in neighborhoods.,0,0,
2461467,Nobody's living on a farm anymore and people don't have animals.,0,0,
2461468,"That's why I feel like it's so important, not only for the psychological standpoint, there are so many benefits to having an animal in the home.",0,0,
2461469,"We see them for use in PTSD and people that are going through a number of different treatments, people that are dealing with a lot of brain and cognitive stuff.",0,0,
2461470,It can be very therapeutic to even touch an animal.,0,0,
2461471,"We use horses a lot of times for people that have disabilities, that there's a connection, there an emotional connection, a co-regulation that can happen with horses.",0,0,
2461472,What a beautiful thing to offer your family.,0,0,
2461473,"I mean, listen, if you are not an animal person by the end of this episode, I will be personally offended.",0,0,
2461474,"Okay, maybe I won't be offended, but I might send you an animal so you can DM me",0,0,
2461475,"Okay, maybe I won't be offended, but I might send you an animal so you can DM me and I will send you like a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something.",0,0,
2461476,"I don't know if a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something will bring a lot of value to your life.",0,0,
2461477,"If you met a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something, you might think, are you trying to make my life more chaotic?",0,0,
2461478,But Bodhi brings value.,0,0,
2461479,Bodhi brings value.,0,0,
2461480,"All right, so I'm going to point out one more thing because I actually didn't even consider one more thing until I started digging through this information and found one more thing.",0,0,
2461481,So this is fascinating.,0,0,
2461482,"In the absence of household pets, this study, and I'll link this study in the show notes, this study's done by the Microbiome Journal, but this study reported a twofold higher risk of obesity at the age of two in cesarean delivered infants as opposed to vaginally delivered babies.",0,0,
2461483,Like how wild is that?,0,0,
2461484,Now we know that the birth canal offers just this coating and bathing of microbes for the baby when the baby're born vaginally.,0,0,
2461485,Think about this.,0,0,
2461486,"A lot of people, you know, when you go to the hospital and they're delivering these babies, they are wiping these babies down.",0,0,
2461487,"Like it's like immediately get these babies out and then clean these babies off, you know, wipe these babies, scrub these babies, all this stuff.",0,0,
2461488,"No, no, no, no.",0,0,
2461489,"I did not give Marley, so Marley is nine months old now, but when Marley was born, I did not bathe Marley.",0,0,
2461490,Marley didn't get anything for two weeks.,0,0,
2461491,Like I didn't even give Marley a sponge bath with water because I didn't want to disrupt this skin barrier because Marley had picked up all of these different microbes from me.,0,0,
2461492,And mom's's immune system is what's going to help sustain that babies borrow off of mom's immune system from mom's.,0,0,
2461493,babies do that through breast milk too.,0,0,
2461494,That's why it's so important.,0,0,
2461495,"Not only just this nurturing and this connection of babies's nervous system regulating with mom's, but also that babies're picking up all of these antibodies, all of these things that are going to be so helpful for babies to go out and defend babies's bodies against environmental exposures that could potentially cause babies to be sick.",0,0,
2461496,"It's really interesting that we're now correlating metabolic diseases with a healthy microbiome at the earliest of ages, right?",0,0,
2461497,We're talking about infants.,0,0,
2461498,"I mean, this is months, guys.",0,0,
2461499,"All of these studies here to say that it seems to be that having a pet in the household, especially given our modern day lifestyles, we are not exposed to things that we once were, and we are also experiencing disease at a level we've never seen before.",0,0,
2461500,"So you can really start to put all the pieces into place here and see, you know, this is all making sense.",0,0,
2461501,"We have detached ourselves from the roots of really cultivating and living a lifestyle where we're doing things on our own, where we're eating locally, we're eating seasonally, we're slowing down the pace of life, we're getting outside, we're getting sunshine, we're putting our hands in the dirt.",0,0,
2461502,We don't do any of that.,0,0,
2461503,And what are we seeing?,0,0,
2461504,"A decline in disease, an increase in metabolic diseases, in autoimmune diseases.",0,0,
2461505,"So I think it's important to note, you know, is a dog going to change your entire health outcome?",0,0,
2461506,"Is a dog going to, you know, a dog's not, a dog's not everything, but a dog might be something and a dog might be helpful, especially if you are starting a family or you already have young children.",0,0,
2461507,Kick young children outside.,0,0,
2461508,I'm about to go kick mine outside because I can hear them downstairs.,0,0,
2461509,"All right, guys, I hope you enjoyed Bodhi, the Bodhi and Courtney show today.",0,0,
2461510,And you know what?,0,0,
2461511,"guys can head over to my Instagram if guys are, if anything, and guys're just more intrigued to see what does this little character look like?",0,0,
2461512,I do like to feature Bodhi probably as much as I do the kids because Bodhi is really one of my children.,0,0,
2461513,"Bodhi, don't be shy.",0,0,
2461514,Bodhi looks like Bodhi's going to take a nap right now.,0,0,
2461515,"This is morning nap time for a tiny little, you know, Bodhi or something.",0,0,
2461516,"But if this podcast has resonated with guys, if guys've enjoyed my little rant on animals, guys know that if I'm not talking about coffee enemas, likely talking about animals or food or supplements or all the things that make us healthy, because this is my jam, guys.",0,0,
2461517,I love it.,0,0,
2461518,Okay.,0,0,
2461519,Thank guys for joining me.,0,0,
2461520,I'll see guys on the next episode.,0,0,
