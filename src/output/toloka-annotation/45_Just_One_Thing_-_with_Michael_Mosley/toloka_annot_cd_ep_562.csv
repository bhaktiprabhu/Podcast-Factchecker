2465109,"I'm Dr Michael Moseley and this podcast from the BBC World Service is Just One Thing, where each episode we'll explore one thing you can start doing today to improve your health or life in ways you might not expect.",0,0,
2465110,I do a lot of writing in my day job as a journalist and an author.,0,0,
2465111,"But today, sitting at my computer, I'm going to try something very different.",0,0,
2465112,What I'm writing now is not for publication or for sharing with anyone else.,0,0,
2465113,"Now it's called expressive writing and despite the name, it can be done with pen and paper or on the computer as I'm doing now.",0,0,
2465114,"The idea is you put aside 15 minutes to write about your deepest emotions and the thoughts you have about the things that are keeping you up at night, worrying you.",0,0,
2465115,Studies have shown that doing this can have some surprising health benefits.,0,0,
2465116,It can improve your sleep.,0,0,
2465117,"It has a positive impact on many physical ailments like asthma, arthritis.",0,0,
2465118,It's even been shown to improve the well-being of breast cancer patients.,0,0,

2465120,"It's supposed to be particularly effective if you've got a lot on your mind, like Julie from Hull.",0,0,
2465121,Julie from Hull works in the NHS and is very busy.,0,0,
2465122,I think that picking up the pen or the keyboard is just one thing that will give Julie from Hull's health a boost.,0,0,
2465123,"Hi, Julie from Hull.",0,0,
2465124,"Hi, Michael.",0,0,
2465125,"So Michael understand Michael're a bit like Michael, a bit of a warrior.",0,0,
2465126,How often do Michael find Michael just can't stop thinking about something?,0,0,
2465127,It's usually most days at the moment.,0,0,
2465128,Michael think it's due to the fact that Michael'm just so busy and there is just so much to do during the day.,0,0,
2465129,Michael's mind is just full.,0,0,
2465130,What work do you do?,0,0,
2465131,Julie from Hull work for the NHS.,0,0,
2465132,"Right, so it's pretty stressful at the best of times.",0,0,
2465133,"It's very challenging at the moment, yes.",0,0,
2465134,"I work in a non-clinical role, so I'm not patient-facing.",0,0,
2465135,"But even so, there is a lot to do on a day-to-day basis.",0,0,
2465136,"And then when we finish our work, there's obviously the challenges of running a family in a home as well.",0,0,
2465137,So how many kids have Julie from Hull got?,0,0,
2465138,I've just got one boy.,0,0,
2465139,one boy's 14.,0,0,
2465140,Those are the stressful years.,0,0,
2465141,I do remember they become challenging.,0,0,
2465142,"And you also worry about them, don't you?",0,0,
2465143,Absolutely.,0,0,
2465144,They're at such a critical stage in their lives and you worry how that is all going to end up.,0,0,
2465145,Absolutely.,0,0,
2465146,"All Michael can say is, on the whole, they turn out well.",0,0,
2465147,But it doesn't feel like it at the time.,0,0,
2465148,Thank Michael.,0,0,
2465149,That's good to know.,0,0,
2465150,"Well, I'm going to ask Julie from Hull to set aside 15 minutes on three separate occasions over the next week to write down Julie from Hull's thoughts and feelings.",0,0,
2465151,"This sort of expressive writing has all sorts of benefits for your mood, your immune system, and even your memory.",0,0,
2465152,And you should start to feel the benefits within a week.,0,0,
2465153,Sounds good.,0,0,
2465154,I'll give This sort of expressive writing a go.,0,0,
2465155,I've asked Julie from Hull to write down Julie from Hull's thoughts over the next week.,0,0,
2465156,"And that's because expressive writing can be surprisingly beneficial for your brain, your wellbeing, and your life.",0,0,
2465157,"Now, Julie from Hull might think that focusing on things that have gone wrong and writing about things that have gone wrong would make things worse.",0,0,
2465158,But the opposite seems to be true.,0,0,
2465159,"Research suggests that expressive writing can, in fact, reduce negative thoughts.",0,0,
2465160,And boost your mood.,0,0,
2465161,And it doesn't take long.,0,0,
2465162,"In one study, people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions's thoughts on three separate occasions not only found that doing so improved the quality of people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions's sleep, but it also reduced how often people who were asked to spend 15 minutes writing down their thoughts on three separate occasions had negative thoughts.",0,0,
2465163,"Of course, if you've just experienced a significant trauma or are feeling completely overwhelmed, it would be advisable to go to your GP or another health professional.",0,0,
2465164,"But if it's low-level anxiety, the sort of thoughts that are keeping you up at night, expressive writing really could help.",0,0,
2465165,And expressive writing may even boost your brain power.,0,0,
2465166,"Studies have shown that doing expressive writing before an exam can improve performance by offloading, distracting worrisome thoughts, and freeing up working memory.",0,0,
2465167,And the benefits don't seem to be simply psychological.,0,0,
2465168,"Recent studies have shown some surprising benefits of expressive writing on your physical health, such as your immune system.",0,0,
2465169,"Researchers in New Zealand, for example, asked a group of medical students to write about personal traumatic events the day before a group of medical students were vaccinated.",0,0,
2465170,"Amazingly, six months after receiving the vaccine, a group of medical students had a stronger immune response and far higher antibody levels than a control group who merely had the vaccine.",0,0,
2465171,"Randomised controlled trials, the gold standard of studies, have also shown that asthma patients use less medication and arthritis patients feel less pain after doing expressive writing.",0,0,
2465172,"And encouragingly for patients recovering from cancer treatments, a small randomised controlled trial found that patients with early-stage breast cancer reported fewer coughs, headaches, less chest pain and stomach upset, and attended fewer cancer-related medical appointments in the months after patients with early-stage breast cancer had written about patients with early-stage breast cancer's feelings compared to a control group.",0,0,
2465173,Professor James Pennebaker was the first scientist to investigate how expressive writing can benefit health back in the 1980s.,0,0,
2465174,I'll be speaking to Professor James Pennebaker later in the programme.,0,0,
2465175,"First, let's find out how Julie is getting on with Julie's writing challenge.",0,0,
2465176,I've just written my first expressive writing.,0,0,
2465177,It surprised Julie how much Julie've actually written and Julie have gone over the 15 minutes and didn't realise.,0,0,
2465178,Julie'm quite surprised how much Julie have written and how frank and honest it actually looks as well.,0,0,
2465179,Julie don't usually write during the day.,0,0,
2465180,Usually Julie'm typing at a computer screen or using Julie's mobile phone so to actually pick up a pen was actually quite nice and the words just did seem to flow.,0,0,
2465181,"Wow, I'm glad that Julie got out Julie's pen and wrote those thoughts away.",0,0,
2465182,We'll catch up with Julie again at the end of the week and see if Julie's still enjoying writing enough to make it just one thing Julie'll keep up.,0,0,
2465183,"But now to find out more about why expressive writing is so powerful, I'm speaking to Professor James Pennebaker.",0,0,
2465184,"Professor James Pennebaker, tell me about that first study.",0,0,
2465185,"I was curious if writing about upsetting topics that people had kept secret, if that could be beneficial.",0,0,
2465186,"So that first study, we brought people in the lab one at a time.",0,0,
2465187,We gave people instructions to write about people's deepest thoughts and feelings about this upsetting experience that people hadn't talked much with others about.,0,0,
2465188,people would write for 15 minutes and then people'd come back the next day.,0,0,
2465189,We had another group running at the same time.,0,0,
2465190,another group were asked to write about superficial topics.,0,0,
2465191,And then we simply just tracked how often people went to the doctor over the next several months.,0,0,
2465192,And what we found was that people who wrote about this upsetting experience that they hadn't talked much with others about ended up going to the doctor at far lower rates than people in our control conditions.,0,0,
2465193,Wow.,0,0,
2465194,Did people who wrote about these traumatic experience share what people who wrote about these traumatic experience were writing with others or was it intended to remain a secret but written down?,0,0,
2465195,We told people who wrote about these traumatic experience that we wanted to keep what people who wrote about these traumatic experience'd written and we would never connect it with who people who wrote about these traumatic experience were.,0,0,
2465196,people who wrote about these traumatic experience didn't read it to us or anybody else.,0,0,
2465197,"Right, because in standard therapy, you're supposed to talk it out.",0,0,
2465198,"But in this case, it was enough just to write it down.",0,0,
2465199,And people who wrote about these traumatic experience were asked to write about some of the most traumatic experiences of people who wrote about these traumatic experience's lives.,0,0,
2465200,Did it have to be a major trauma to work?,0,0,
2465201,No.,0,0,
2465202,"What Professor James Pennebaker usually ask people to do is, Professor James Pennebaker want people to write about any experience that you're worried about that keeps recurring in people's mind.",0,0,
2465203,"So, do Professor James Pennebaker think it's that expressive writing in some ways helping clear your mind?",0,0,
2465204,"You know, there was a couple of really interesting studies looking at this several years ago.",0,0,
2465205,There's a phenomenon called working memory.,0,0,
2465206,working memory is how your mind is constantly thinking about things.,0,0,
2465207,"And if you're under stress, you're not able to take in other information.",0,0,
2465208,You're more forgetful.,0,0,
2465209,You don't sleep as well.,0,0,
2465210,What these researchers found was that expressive writing increased a phenomenon called working memory.,0,0,
2465211,People were now able to think more clearly.,0,0,
2465212,People did better at university in terms of People's grades.,0,0,
2465213,People slept better.,0,0,
2465214,"We know that when somebody is stressed and they're obsessing about things, their heart beats faster, their immune system is suppressed.",0,0,
2465215,"And when a person writes about an upsetting experience, you find certain enhancements in immune activity that the immune system is working more efficiently.",0,0,
2465216,Wow.,0,0,
2465217,Can you tell me what you think the mechanism is?,0,0,
2465218,Did the mechanism lead to measurable changes in the body?,0,0,
2465219,So there have been several studies looking at this.,0,0,
2465220,several studies looking at this do what's called a punch biopsy.,0,0,
2465221,a punch biopsy's a small five millimeter punch in your skin.,0,0,
2465222,And several studies looking at this look and see how long it takes to heal.,0,0,
2465223,And what several studies looking at this do in several studies looking at this is several studies looking at this have people write about emotional upheavals in the days prior to a punch biopsy.,0,0,
2465224,"And with expressive writing, people heal more quickly than if people're writing about superficial topics.",0,0,
2465225,And what's particularly intriguing is several studies looking at this're finding these changes using these ultrasound measures that are markers of healing.,0,0,
2465226,"But several studies looking at this're also finding these changes with these more elegant immune markers, hormones and peptides that are associated with the healing process itself.",0,0,
2465227,How big are several studies looking at this?,0,0,
2465228,"I mean, are several studies looking at this convincing?",0,0,
2465229,Part of it is you have to look at how many studies have been done.,0,0,
2465230,There have been a couple of thousand studies.,0,0,
2465231,"In most of the studies, you find improvements in physical health.",0,0,
2465232,"But the effects are, the effects are modest.",0,0,
2465233,"What's so striking about this is that we're only asking them to write, say, 15 minutes a day for three or four days.",0,0,
2465234,"As an intervention, it's free, it's fast, it's easy.",0,0,
2465235,Does this kind of writing also benefit your social life?,0,0,
2465236,"Yes, this kind of writing does.",0,0,
2465237,"What we found was that people who wrote about this upsetting experience, people who wrote about this upsetting experience's social behaviors changed.",0,0,
2465238,"A month later, people who wrote about this upsetting experience were talking more with others.",0,0,
2465239,people who wrote about this upsetting experience were more socially engaged.,0,0,
2465240,people who wrote about this upsetting experience laughed more.,0,0,
2465241,"One reason that this can be so powerful is that when you write, you get these upsetting experiences out of your mind.",0,0,
2465242,You're now able to connect with other people better.,0,0,
2465243,You're able to listen to other people.,0,0,
2465244,You're able to be a better friend.,0,0,
2465245,Right.,0,0,
2465246,"So if I want to undertake this kind of writing, can you talk me through how I start?",0,0,
2465247,"First of all, I'm not here to sell you a bona fide, copyrighted system.",0,0,
2465248,Experiment and see what works best for you.,0,0,
2465249,Set aside three or four days.,0,0,
2465250,Find 10 or 15 minutes and just sit down and write.,0,0,
2465251,And the only rule I have is to write continuously.,0,0,
2465252,Don't worry about grammar or sentence structure or spelling.,0,0,
2465253,"And in fact, plan to throw it away afterwards.",0,0,
2465254,I discovered a method several years ago that I call finger writing.,0,0,
2465255,Just writing with my finger in the air.,0,0,
2465256,finger writing also works quite well.,0,0,
2465257,"And if after two or three days you find that you're not benefiting from finger writing at all, then stop writing.",0,0,
2465258,Do something else.,0,0,
2465259,"You know, go jogging.",0,0,
2465260,"This is not one true way, but it's a remarkably effective system.",0,0,
2465261,Right.,0,0,
2465262,That's the science.,0,0,
2465263,Time to check in with Julie.,0,0,
2465264,Let's find out if expressive writing is something Julie'll carry on with.,0,0,
2465265,I really enjoyed the three sessions.,0,0,
2465266,Julie did find it was more beneficial to write on an evening before bedtime.,0,0,
2465267,It just felt as though Julie was able to just clear Julie's mind and Julie's thoughts.,0,0,
2465268,"And Julie did actually have an uninterrupted sleep that evening, which was great.",0,0,
2465269,"Julie really enjoyed the part where Julie was able to just spend some time by Julie and download Julie's thoughts and feelings and just create some space, really.",0,0,
2465270,Julie've actually signed up for a creative writing course.,0,0,
2465271,"So yeah, really enjoyed it",0,0,
2465272,"So yeah, really enjoyed expressive writing and Julie will be taking expressive writing forward.",0,0,
2465273,I am really glad to hear that Julie has got so much out of Julie's writing.,0,0,
2465274,And I've been doing it all week,0,0,
2465275,And I've been doing expressive writing all week and I do think expressive writing's made a difference.,0,0,
2465276,Perhaps helped Julie's sleep a bit.,0,0,
2465277,Today I'm trying Professor Pennebaker's finger writing method.,0,0,
2465278,I've decided to come to my local woods and I'm here to wave my finger in the air.,0,0,
2465279,It's always nice to have an excuse to come outside.,0,0,
2465280,"If you haven't heard it yet, check out our Green Spaces episode from Series 1 on BBC Sounds.",0,0,
2465281,"I do think taking up something like expressive writing can be really worth it, especially if you're a bit anxious and you don't need a computer or pen to do expressive writing and your relationships, your brain and your immune system could benefit.",0,0,
2465282,So that's it.,0,0,
2465283,"expressive writing's just one thing you can incorporate into your daily routine, which really could benefit your body and life.",0,0,

2465290,From uncovering the unconscious reason we shake hands.,0,0,
2465291,There is a lot of information lying inside our body odour.,0,0,
2465292,To asking why we do things that are bad for us.,0,0,
2465293,"If we weren't programmed to be more risk-tolerant, the species wouldn't have survived.",0,0,
