2465852,"Oh god, that's not good.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465853,There's lots of kind of blue in my mouth and a particularly big bit of blue between my teeth.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465854,That must be an area where I missed when I was brushing.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465855,But at least I am giving it a go.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465856,"Here in the UK, a quarter of all adults don't brush their teeth twice a day.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465857,"And when it comes to men, it is one in three who don't.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465858,"Good dental hygiene has some obvious advantages, such as preventing cavities.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465859,"But beyond teeth, studies have shown that brushing and using interdental brushes on those tricky to reach bits may reduce your risk of stroke, stave off dementia and benefit your overall health.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465860,"So better brushing, better health.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465861,I'm speaking to Laurie from North Wales.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465862,Let's see if improving her dental hygiene is just one thing she'd like to focus on.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465863,"Hello, Laurie.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465864,Hi.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465865,Do you have good teeth or is a like mine full of fillings?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465866,Full of fillings.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465867,"They're not too bad, but yeah, there's definitely a few issues with them.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465868,OK.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465869,So tell me about your tooth brushing technique.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465870,"Try and hit all areas, I think.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465871,"You do it twice a day, do you?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465872,Not every day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465873,Definitely once a day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465874,And do you ever floss or use interdental brushes to get the little bits out?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465875,No.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465876,What about late night snacks?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465877,"Yes, I definitely do like a late night snack.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465878,So do you make sure to brush your teeth before you go to bed?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465879,After you've had your late night snack?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465880,Not every time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465881,No.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465882,You are very honest.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465883,I like that.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465884,So I have a simple but important challenge for you this week.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465885,I want you to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465886,Do it once when you wake and once before bed after that snack.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465887,"And do make sure you use the interdental brush at least once a day, preferably in the evening.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465888,It won't take much of your time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465889,Do you think you can manage that?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465890,Definitely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465891,"Yeah, I can definitely do that.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465892,I've asked Lurie to focus on her pearly white smile this week because preventing the buildup of bacteria in your gums can have big long-term benefits.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465893,"Although some bacteria in your mouth are helpful, the ones that cause gum disease can affect your whole body, causing damage in organs far away from your mouth.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465894,"For example, keeping your gums in good shape can benefit your heart.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465895,"According to a huge study conducted on over 10,000 men and women from the Scottish Health Survey, people who brush their teeth twice a day have lower rates of heart disease than those who brush once a day or less.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465896,Why?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465897,"Well, one suggestion is that when bacteria from your mouth leak into your blood, this activates an immune response.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465898,"In the short term, that can be helpful.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465899,"But if it continues, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which damages the heart.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465900,"These bacteria can also damage the inner lining of your blood vessels, increasing fatty buildup, which in turn can affect blood flow to your vital organs.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465901,Good oral hygiene could also help your body in its battle against diseases like COVID.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465902,"An Egyptian study, which looked at over 300 patients who had recovered from COVID, found that people with healthy gums were less likely to be severely affected.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465903,"Another study found that COVID patients with gum disease were over three times as likely to be admitted to intensive care, and these patients were nine times as likely to die from the illness.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465904,Another really good reason for keeping your teeth and gums in good shape is doing so may also protect your brain.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465905,A recent study of stroke patients revealed that over 80% had blood clots that showed the presence of oral bacteria.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465906,"And another study showed that people who have severe periodontal disease, that's inflamed gums, are also at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465907,I'll be speaking to a scientist about this surprising mouth-brain connection in a moment.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465908,"But first, let's check in with Lori to see how she's getting on with the challenge.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465909,"So I'm about halfway through the week and my teeth look amazing, the best they've looked in a long time.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465910,I'm enjoying doing it in the evenings.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465911,It feels like self-care.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465912,It's quite nice to take that time out and sit there and use the interdental brushes.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465913,"I've stuck to cleaning my teeth twice a day, every single day.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465914,"It's actually helped me with the snacking, because obviously once I've done my teeth, I then end up not snacking in the evening, so that's been great.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465915,"So yeah, really enjoying the task and really pleased with how it's going.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465916,"It's great to hear Lori is enjoying her clean teeth challenge and it's helped her cut out some late night snacks, which is a bonus.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465917,We'll check in with her one final time at the end of the week.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465918,"But now to find out why looking after your teeth and your mouth is so important for your health and your brain, I'm talking to Dr Sim Singh Rao from the University of Central Lancashire's School of Dentistry.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465919,Good day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465920,Good day.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465921,What exactly is gum disease?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465922,It is formed by bacteria in the mouth.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465923,It's like the dental plaque or the bacteria wedge between the gum and the enamel and forms pockets.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465924,Eventually it erodes the soft tissues and even the hard tissues and then the teeth fall out.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465925,"Now obviously gum disease is bad for your mouth, but how does it affect the rest of your body?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465926,So there is this intermittent drip of bacteria from bleeding gums.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465927,"Once that goes into the bloodstream, it can go to different organs all over the body.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465928,"And we do know things like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, they're all related to periodontal disease or gum disease.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465929,So they can also cross the blood-brain barrier and get into your brain.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465930,"And that is your area of research, is that right?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465931,The mouth-brain connection.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465932,Yes.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465933,"So initially we obtained a brain tissue from diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients and we examined Alzheimer's disease brains and non-Alzheimer's disease brains in the laboratory and looking for signatures of DNA from these bacteria from the gum, as well as any proteins that might be associated with them.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465934,And we found they were exclusively within the Alzheimer's disease brains and not in the non-Alzheimer's control brains.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465935,"So you're looking at this brain tissue, it was only in the Alzheimer's patients that you actually found the presence of these particular bacteria?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465936,That's correct.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465937,"That must have been an exciting moment, also slightly disturbing.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465938,"The idea that you can go from the mouth to the brain to dementia is a very big step, isn't it?",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465939,Absolutely.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465940,"As soon as we published our first study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, we were constantly being asked, well, can you show us that they actually get to the brain?",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465941,It's incredible.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465942,So the next study we conducted was in collaboration with the University of Florida.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465943,So what they did was they caused periodontal disease experimentally in mice and what we found was that those bacteria had entered the brains of those mice.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465944,Clearly the message is that oral health is unbelievably important for your body and your and what are the best ways of looking after your teeth and your mouth generally?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465945,What are your top tips?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465946,Top tips are obviously clean your mouth twice a day at least for two minutes each time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465947,"First thing in the morning, last thing at night.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465948,And also use fluoride toothpaste and brush it,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465949,and then you can let some of the toothpaste linger on into your teeth and gums so that it has the added protection for a little bit longer to act on the teeth.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465950,So I'm told spit but don't rinse.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465951,What about the tongue?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465952,Do you do anything with your tongue?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465953,"Well, our research has actually shown the tongue gets very dirty.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465954,That was a surprise.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465955,"Definitely, I think it's important to clean the tongue.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465956,What do you think about mouthwashes?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465957,Good or bad?,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465958,"Well, I think they have their place.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465959,We should really go by when the dentist has recommended its use and for how long.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465960,"Alternatively, if you feel that you want to use a mouthwash then I would certainly make sure that you understand the instructions on them.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465961,So brush for two minutes including your tongue and just spit.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465962,Don't rinse your mouth afterwards.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465963,Most of us would also benefit from flossing or using interdental brushes before we brush our teeth.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465964,A study of dental students in Iran found that flossing before rather than after removed the most plaque.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465965,Another tip from the British Dental Association is to brush before breakfast and to wait a full hour after your evening meal to brush again.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465966,"And that's because eating creates acid in the mouth, weakening your enamel.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465967,Brushing too soon after a meal can actually damage your teeth.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465968,So there we go.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465969,Let's check in with Lurie one final time.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465970,Let's find out if she has been able to stick to her new oral hygiene routine.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465971,It's the end of the week and I've actually really enjoyed the task that I was given.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465972,I've really surprised myself by how relaxing I found the interdental brushes.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465973,Aesthetically it's been brilliant.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465974,My teeth have never looked this good.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465975,"People have even commented on how white they are, which has never happened before.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465976,"But it's also really good to know that I am doing something that could prevent dementia, could reduce my chance of getting heart disease.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465977,So it's definitely a win-win and definitely something that I will continue doing as we go forward.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465978,I'm delighted to hear that Lurie will be sticking with her new routine.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465979,I've also been paying particular attention to my dental hygiene this week.,Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465980,"I already regularly flossed and brushed my teeth before this challenge, but since I started using those plaque disclosing tablets, I've begun to focus on areas where I obviously hadn't been that thorough.",Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465981,"I do believe that doing this will not only help me keep my teeth for as long as possible, but also offer health benefits beyond my mouth.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465982,"Floss or use an interdental brush, then apply the electric toothbrush and your gums, your heart and your brain will thank you.",Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
2465983,So that's it.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,

2465990,Young people are so concerned about the state of the earth and then they are labelled as hysterical.,Not Checkworthy,0,0,,
